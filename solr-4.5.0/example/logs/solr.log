, Works fine, could do w/o having to use Jet Dry. Build seems a little light compared to old, but sucky LG
, We purchased this dishwasher and have only used it a few times. However, it is very quiet and efficient. I would def purchase this again!
, really don't have any problems with this and it looks great, also loads very easily.
, Real modern dish washer! Great look in my kitchen. Everybody likes it.
, I was shocked by how quiet this washer is. I got it delivered and installed cheaper than anywhere else.
, I was surprised how quiet it is. It cleans the dishes very well and the racks are very well designed. The silverware tray is on the door which gives you more room.
, great dishwasher.i would recommend to others.washes real well and its quiet
, Good buy good store xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
, This dishwasher is very light and easy to install. It has the control buttons on the top and out of sight, which is what my wife wanted. It's very sleek and quiet. We were going to get the one with the stainless steel tub, but it was over $300 more tha...
, Excellent quality, price, features, and performance. Delivered by promised date. A great product.
, Very quiet machine had to open several times just to make sure it was still going. Could not get it to dry well on all dry modes and had to use the jet dry stuff but dries dishes fine now.
, Great so far,,very quiet,cleans great and I like the different options available on cycles,,etc
, Great value at the sale price. So quiet it can be run at anytime.
, We bought this dishwasher to replace one that broke in our house. After looking at the options, we settled on this one because of the features, the style, and the quality. Overall, we have been very happy with it. It cleans the dishes well, it is nice ...
, I wish that they could figure out a way for the dishwasher to dry the dishes, it does okay with the metal and glass dishes, but the plastic is always wet. Overall, we are really happy with it
, I had a kitchen aid for over 20 years it worked very well, but just could not spend that kind of money again. I checked all reviews and this one had good reviews so I went with it, so far I really like it.
, Great value. Great commercial look for low price. Fits beautifully. Perfect match to other commercial grade appliances.
, excellent appliance especially for the price, it is very quiet and performs wonderfully
, I have had $2,000 dishwashers that were not as reliable as this fairly basic unit. Whirlpool according to those who work on them can't be beat and I agree. I have bought 3 of this same models for all my homes.
, I like the dishwasher with the exception of the fact that the controls are on the top of the lid and are not easily reached under the cabinet.
, After our 18 year old dishwasher retired, we took months researching our options for a new one. Finally, we decided on this Whirlpool dishwasher and have been very please so far. The loading options help with the variety of dishes we use, and the machi...
, Meets my expectations for a reasonably priced unit. So quiet I can rarely tell it is running.
, The purchase, delivery and set up process for this dishwasher was seamless. If your looking for a moderate priced reliable dishwasher this is the one for you. I don't use this with heavy stuck on gunk.
, I decided to buy this dishwasher because of the great reviews on here. After buying my first house, the HOTPOINT from 2000 was starting to deteriorate, so slowly converting the kitchen into stainless steel was starting to be my best route, and this Whi...
, I have a cabinet right next to where I put the dishwasher and when I would open the cabinet it would hit the dishwasher.
, This dishwasher is absolutely beautiful in my kitchen. The handle is sleek and easy to get open. All the buttons are on the top so you can't see them while the dishwasher door is closed. The inside capacity is great as well. Will accommodate large bowl...
, This was an easy choice buying our second Whirlpool dishwasher.Our previous one ran great for nearly 10 years.Sharp looking,quiet operation and cleans dishes very well too!
, The Whirlpool - Gold Series 24 Tall Tub Built-In Dishwasher - Stainless-Steel was exactly what I was looking for at a great price. Installation went very well. I only wish there was a light on the front of the door that indicates it is on and or when ...
, The dish rack that works best for bowls causes the bowls to be too tight together to really get cleaned. So, we've ended up leaving a space between bowls in rack, which doesn't feel like a great use of the space. It took several tries before we found t...
, Other than the instructions being almost non-existent, the dishwasher was an excellent buy.
, Very quiet dishwasher with easy to use controls. Intuitive control layout with enough cycle choices for all needs. Two complaints, first the silverware holder slots are too small to hold all silverware as well as being small overall. Also, for installa...
, Great product for the price. It was easy to install by myself. Lots of options including energy saving washing and drying. Has worked great for us so far. Very quiet!
, I've only had this about a month now but have no complaints very happy with this purchase especially for the price!! I love that u can wash without the top rack in for the bigger pots and pans! Also that u can wash top rack only so u don't have to wait...
, I haven;t had the dishwasher for very long yet, but so far it has been great. I purchased the unit primarily for its appearance and price because we are trying to sell our house in the coming year, but the features, cleaning ability and sound level are...
, So, this was on sale...I bought it...and was hoping for more. My old dishwasher just wasn't getting the dishes as clean as I would have liked. This one seems to be about the same. I'm one who usually washes dishes before I put them in the dishwasher, s...
, Great dishwasher and I would recommend it to anyone. It is very quiet and cleans well
, Have had the unit for a month, no problems, pretty quiet, good value for the price
, The dishwasher is quiet and has great capacity. It matches my other Whirlpool appliances that were bought 2 years ago.
, This dishwasher really works well. My glasses and dishes haven't looked this good since they were new. Sitting just a few feet from the dishwasher I can still hear the TV without turning it way up. I am still learning about all the features and setting...
, A great dishwasher for the price. Who needs dozens of settings and bells and whistles? Will it clean my dishes? Good. That's all I need. Efficient too.
, Very quiet, great cleaning options, smart shelf layout and attractive.
, The sale price was good value. Works as well as my mother's Kitchen-Aid dishwasher. I always use the Sensor Wash setting and glassware and dishes are cleaner than any dishwasher that I ever owned while being energy efficient. It's quiet.
, I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about when complaining about it being loud. All I know is my kids had to ask if it was on when we started it the first time. And my biggest issue with the old one, I don't have to turn the volume up on...
, great deal for the price. Ours is very quiet and cleans well. Utensil tray is a little difficut to fill and remove, but not a big deal. Nice clean look. Provided it continues to run well I would give it 5 stars, we have had it for about 2 months.
, Great value for $430, same Kenmore(Whirlpool made) was $549 at the time I bought. So far so good. With the price i paid i also got a square deal 5 year warranty for $130 which equals the Sears price. If you use a dishwasher everyday like we do i reccom...
, A little more than I wanted but has surpassed my expectations.
, Great price after discounts and reward certificates. Don't pay over $400 for this machine. The only reason for the 4-stars was for the long long wash/dry cycle; otherwise it wouldve been 5 stars I've finally received the right item. It was installed co...
, I paid about $429 for this model and it included free delivery and installation. My previous dishwasher of 7 years had a vast array of options but I only remember hitting anything other than normal wash twice (that was in the first month). I wanted som...
, The dishwasher was on sale and I got free installation.
, Needed a dishwasher and didn't waste time on the great Presidents sale. Heat dry feature dries the dishes for the most part but leaves a lot of condensation on others and along the walls of the machine. I thought washer would have been a little quieter...

Well worth the investment. You can barely hear it and the dishes come out great. Very hard for the littles ones to get into as well
, Holds all my dishes I need easily. The racks that can change are nice as well! Super quiet. After about an hour we forget it is running and we hear a little water noise and forget that we have it running!
, I haven't had it for a long time but from I have seen so far I would recommend it
, A quiet machine, works well for everything we threw at it. Written directions are not very clear, does not operate intuitively.
, This dishwasher is great. I am able to run the dishes in the evening with out noise.
, great machine. Very quiet and cleans dishes very well
, I have owned many dishwashers in my lifetime and this Bosch product is the worst one I have ever purchased. The bottom rack falls out constantly because it is gravity-guided and the rollers have no secure track to guide them. In fact, after 4 months of...
, This was an open box item. There was evidence that there had been a botched attempt to instal the dishwasher. The hidden damage I encountered caused me to wonder, but it seems to run just fine using it these few weeks. It is so quiet, I check on it to ...
, The dishwasher is highly rated and very reasonably priced. We are able to watch TV when it's on because it is so quiet. We waited to go to bed before we started our old one because it was so noisy. There is a few second delay when you press buttons. My...
, Our old dishwasher was so loud we had to turn the TV up to drown out the noise. You cant even tell this one is running. Cleans great an drys good. Very pleased with this product!
, This Bosch Dishwasher is very quiet and we use it almost every day
, Bosch got #1 in Consumer Reports and the price was very reasonable. The unit is very quiet and the water pressure cleans most dishes. The top water sprayers drip water even hours after the last cycle has run.
, Very happy with the product, would buy it again if the situation came up.
, We purchased this to replace the builder's grade model we had in our home. There is no comparison between the two. This dishwasher gets the dishes perfectly clean, and it does it almost totally silently. It is amazing!
, We had a high end LG dishwasher prior to this that we had all kinds of troubles with and the dishes did not come out very clean. We decided to go with a cheaper dishwasher than last time and the Bosch series and we are very happy. The dishes come out c...
, I love how quiet this dishwasher is, we can watch tv & run the dishwasher at the same time. It cleans & dries very well. The one thing I don't like is the smell when there are dirty dishes in it. My cheap noisy one that came with the house never smelle...
, Overall a very good dishwasher, but does lack a little in space.
, I am very disappointed in this dishwasher. I am a single person and do not cook very much so my dishes are never very dirty going into the dishwasher. No oils, no baked on food etc. just dishes, glasses, cups. The book says to use powdered dishwasher s...
, Good looking and does a good job. It is very quiet
, Still learning how it works. So far everything washes really well. Don't like the fact that I don't know how long it is going to run. It also loads very different from my last one. Don't think I can get as much into it. Wish I would have look at a bett...
, Very nice dishwasher. Really like how quiet it runs and it does a great job on cleaning the dishes. Nice basket for silverware.
, I wish I would have purchased the model with more features, e.g. Wash and hold. It's very quiet.
, It is ok, but don't like the fact that you have to use the sanitize option to get the dry dishes. There is no heated dry cycle. Also don't like that I have to check and clean a filter in the bottom.
, I was surprised how quest it was. I was worried when I saw that the racks were slanted a little, that is very different then my old dishwasher, but it works way better. I am pleased.
, I believe this is a great dishwasher. We have only had it for almost a month but will comment later after some time.
, I do all the dishes in our house. I love this dishwasher. It's quiet, cleans really well, and has all the features we were looking for. I highly recommend this product.
, This unit was not made for standard USA cabinet measurements.Interior layout for your dishes is not the greatest.
, The first time I pulled the bottom rack out to put in dirty plates, it fell off the very slim track and a wheel fell off. I have to be extremely careful when pulling either the top or bottom rack out, I am afraid they will break. Bowls just don't seem ...
, Very disappointed with this dishwasher. It has a horrible smell from the first time we used it until now nearly 5 months later. We have tried making sure our dishes are rinsed well first, but it doesn't make a difference, it has a foul odor all the tim...
, This dishwasher is a replacement for a whirlpool gold. The Bosch is quieter and cleaner than the whirlpool, and dries the dishes better even without a heating element.
, Overall the Bosch is alright you just cannot be in a hurry to get the dishes done and you have to hand dry them after the cycle is over as they are still wet when it has completed
, Replaced a nearly 20 year old dishwasher, so anything was going to be an improvement. I thought Bosch was out of our price range, but this low end one was comparable to others we were looking at. Easy to install (we did it ourselves), and it runs so qu...
, It does what I need it to do -- wash well without pre-scrubbing and quiet! Right now, I have rather thick ceramic ware. These are bit more difficult to load and arrange so I feel like I'm wasting space in order to arrange the dishes. This has not been ...
, So far not very happy. Does not get dishes dry. Also found a loose nut in the bottom and don't know where it came from.
, Have had the dishwasher for about a month now and literally have no complaints. Dishes come out clean. If I open the door shortly after the cycle ends the items are so hot I can't handle them without running them under cold water. Hopefully that means ...
, Overall a terrific unit. Excellent value for the money and far better than similarly-priced competitors. The only negative is that while the vertical tines (for lack of a better term) in the lower rack enable the unit to hold many plates, etc, they a...
, a good value for the money, pretty quiet, doesn't fit a huge amount of dishes, and bottom rack could be more well fitted as far as staying on track.
, I was really surprised at how quiet the dishwasher ran. I am completely happy with the features. It has a very sturdy feel to it and looks great. The only thing I was surprised about was that I have to turn the appliance off when completed. Not enough ...
, Just love it. So quiet you don't even know it is on. Fit in perfectly was easy to install. Recommend this product.
, I purchased an open box unit and it is terrific -- very quiet, looks great and cleans dishes well. I'd recommend this.
, Was easy to install. Extremely quiet compared to the 6-year old dishwasher it replaced. Controls are simple and straight forward which is good for everyday use.
, The dish washer seems to clean very well only if you buy name brand detergents. If you use a budget brand, the dish washer seems to have trouble fully rinsing off all of the detergent.
, we are very happy with our Bosch dishwasher, it does an excellent job of cleaning and it super quiet. a great purchase
, It washes the dishes great. But sometimes their NOT dry enough.it is very quite when it runs.
, The dishwasher is a great value for a mid priced dishwasher. Very quiet and cleans dishes nicely.
, We needed to replace a newer Maytag dishwasher because the control panel failed in less than 2 years. This Bosch appeared to be a better product. The price was comparable so why not try it. Maytags simply do not last very long at least not with the wat...
, My previous dishwasher was on its last legs. After shopping, comparing functionality and price, I purchased my new Bosch dishwasher. I'm very happy with it -- it does a great job of cleaning my dishes, and it is very quiet when running.
, I'm enjoying our new dishwasher. The capacity is amazing and you barely know when it is running. Delivery went smoothly.
, We live in a one-room loft, so it was very important to me to have a quiet dishwasher. When the guys installing it ran a test wash, I didn't even know the machine was on. I was ecstatic. I read comments saying that this dishwasher didn't dry well, so...
, I bought this diswasher last year and its quieter than my old bosch. Has all the features I wanted and good value.
, Overall this dishwasher cleans great, drys the dishes just fine, but the rack design is not real good for handling large pans. We run it every night before bedtime so the complaints about drying are not an issue for us. Sometimes the silverware has som...
, This is the first time I have had to buy a dishwasher. I always had what came with the house, both brand new and used. After reading the reviews regarding the dishwasher not drying very well, I was getting discouraged. Well, I have used it twice now ...
, Installed this dishwasher myself. Very easy. After 2 months, I continue to be impressed with how quiet it is and how clean our dishes are. Glasses come out crystal clear.
, This is super quiet. The first few times I used it, I had to double check that it was on. That's how quiet it is. It's a little small for the amount of dishes that it holds, but you get used to it.
, Cleans dishes very well.  You have to empty it or crack the door or your dishwasher will smell due to the dishes not getting completely dry but not a huge concern of mine.
, This dishwasher cleans incredibly well and is very quiet. I did weeks of research before I made my purchase, and the time I invested paid off! The price I paid was below what I planned, and I am confident that I wouldn't have gotten a better product if...
, Except for the salesperson messing up the order on what color it was supposed to be, it is a very good washer. I could've taken it back and got the right one, but when you live 200 miles away from the store, I can't afford the gas to do that. Extremely...
, We have an open-floor plan house, so noise is really an issue. This dishwasher is so quiet, we don't have to turn the TV up any more while the dishwasher is running. You can fit a ton of stuff in it, and everything comes out spotless. I didn't realize ...
, Love how quiet it is. Like the stainless steel interior and racks.
, My last dishwasher was only about 8 months old and came with my new home, but it sounded like a freight train! Not only is this dishwasher beautiful, it cleans everything I put in there and the only way to tell it is running is to stand right in front ...
, Very Quiet, works very well. quiet, 2nd Bosch, great quality, quiet, always reliable, quiet, real craftsmanship, and, by the way, it's quiet!
, My maytag dishwasher conked out after 7 years. I went to S to buy a replacment but their customer service lacks so off to Best Buy I went. I printed the S price for this Bosch dishwasher and Best Buy immediately matched the price and offered fr...
, When I remodeled my kitchen last year I purchased a Samsung dishwasher. It was horrible- it didn't clean dishes at all and made my water glasses filthy with mystery gunk. I had to handwash everything and then put it in the dishwasher... which was point...
, I feel this is way better than the dishwasher , I had before. So Quiet, very Quiet. Only using two weeks , but very happy with it
, We were guided to this washer by the department manager. Everything she told us about the washer was correct. Easy to install, works great, and quiet.
, I love this dishwasher! I am very happy with this purchase. Everything comes out clean and shiny. The food processor at the bottom works very well. There are never any leftover food pieces in the bottom of the dishwasher. There is plenty of room to fit...
, Very good unit. Like stated above, you will not over tighten the l-bracket. Tighten it well or it will leak. Love the fact that it actually dries. Our GE didn't. It is a bit cramped for space. Not as big as old one. Very quiet!
, Extremly quiet. You have to listen very closely to determine if it is running. Dishes are very clean. Easy to load. The Santize and Auto Wash settings are the ones to uses. WE love it!!!
, Turns out one feature I always thought was important on dishwashers really is not important at all with this Bosch dishwasher. Delay start is not needed because, unless you get down on the floor and put your ear on the door, you cannot hear this machin...
, I have done my home work. This thing cleans better then by hand. All I hear is the meditative sounds of water splashing about softly as I sit in front of it. I can barely hear at 10 feet away. I have read all the poor reviews to get a picture of what c...
, This is a great dishwasher for the price. Have confidence in buying this dishwasher.
, This is a great dishwasher, very cost-efficient. It's a little difficult to learn the loading pattern, but it has a large capacity. Dishes and glasses come out spotless.
, washes dishes real well, all plastics dont dry, its very quiet in its operation, the main problem is that when you open the lid after washing, there is a bad smell that comes out. It was professionally installed by Best Buy. We have tried different det...
, Everything we expected and more. Very quiet and love the sanitizer for the dishes.
, I have been looking for a durable, stainless tub dishwasher with affordable price. This is a very good brand dishwasher with so great price plus free home delivery.
, Great price and has all the features I needed. It is so quiet I thought I didn't have it turned on. But it was on I just didn't hear it. Dishes are really clean. My old dishwasher had a heated drying which I never used because it clouded up my drinking...
, Purchased this to replace a high-end GE Profile dishwasher that was dying after about 5 years of service. Over the past 30 years we have owned primarily GE, Whirlpool, and KitchenAid washers - this is our first Bosch appliance. All I can say is WOW! Th...
, Super quiet. I have to stand in front of it to make sure it's on. Dishes come out really clean and dry. Love the 1/2 load option. I have had no problems with the detergent dispenser not opening as mentioned in another review, nor have I had any problem...
, I'd been looking at this model for a while because of the half load feature since the kids are grown and gone. With our open floor plan our old dishwasher was really noisy making TV watching and conversation difficult. This model is very quiet, very ef...
, This replaced a contractor-grade dishwasher, so my opinion may be slightly skewed. This washer cleans extremely well. Combined with a top-quality detergent pak, this even cleaned off hard, baked-on cheese from potatoes au gratin. My wife and I put it i...
, Easy to learn controls, very quiet. Installed it myself no problems, very light with good installation instructions. Made a good choice and the unit runs like a champ.
, I didn't think my dinner plates were overly big, but we have yet to find a good way to load the bottom of the dishwasher (we have had it 3 months). They overlap and just don't fit well with how the bars are spaced.
, The salesman in the Eden Prairie MN store said this model was better than the one I was originally going to purchase and it was on sale. I took his advice and wish I would have paid the higher price for the other dishwasher. This model does not dry the...
, The #1 complaint I hear from people regarding Bosch dishwashers is that they do not dry well. Read the manual; they dry differently than most other dishwashers. The instructions state that if one uses the auto cycle with the Sanitize function along wit...
, So far I am very happy with this dishwasher. Very quiet with no problems.
, This dishwasher was good but I like my dishes ready to put up as soon as they get done. And this is not the dishwasher for that. It does not have a heat-dry option at the end. I don't like having to shake all the water out of my dishes then leave the r...
, great price,free delivery,free install,super quiet.the problem i had was the dishes came out wet.we did everything by the book,called bosch 2 times.bosch finally gave us a number for service,they came out and said it needed a control board and a new je...
, We bought the Bosch a few weeks go after our Kenmore died. I decided on this model because of its high rating on Consumer Reports. So far we've been very satisfied with it. I didn't realize how noisy our Kenmore was until we turned on this machine--it'...
, The first one delivered to us had a huge dent and scratch on it. We refused the delivery. The second one came a week later and was installed. The next day it stopped working. We were told it had a bad circuit board and we told Best Buy to come and get ...
, I am so so happy with my bosch dishwasher. I research everything before I purchase and this was no different. Most sites I visited had 4.5 stars and most complaints were about dishes still being wet and the size of the racks. I simply do not agree, I g...
, My wife and I wanted to upgrade our energy in-efficient appliances after receiving this years tax return. We shopped around for several weeks and researched a variety of models (and from a variety of vendors). After all was said and done, we bought thi...
, This is a great dishwasher if you are looking for something to run quietly. Our family room is pretty open to the Kitchen and with the dishwasher running, you really can't notice with the TV on. Walking into the kitchen you hear a trickle of water. Muc...
, Great dishwasher for the money. Installs easily, cleans & dries well, & is very quiet. We're very happy with this purchase.
, We purchased this to replace our old dishwasher of 10 years. It is MUCH more quiet than our old model. It took some adjustments to how to stack this washer. CONS: I am not a fan of the top rack. Many angles and odd spacing makes it challenging to get o...
, I am extremely pleased with my purchase. The dishwasher is so much quieter than my previous dishwasher and it does an excellent job on cleaning the dishes. It does take more time to do a full load of dishes than my prior dishwasher, but I usually run t...
, It is SOOOO quiet! I love it. Washes great. The only thing I noticed is that it doesnt seem to dry the dishes totally, so if you don't empty out the clean dishes right away there seems to be a musty smell after a couple days. (Like when you leave a loa...
, I have a couple of items to report, first of all Best Buy is great, they scheduled and dilvered the unit as promissed. First class operation in my book. Now lets get to the unit, first of all I chose to install the unit myself and I would like to pass ...
, We've had this dishwasher for about a month now and we have been very happy. It gets the dishes nice and clean; the only downside is that drying takes a bit long, but since we don't have a need/desire to run multiple loads back to back this hasn't been...
, Good basic dishwasher. Not too many bells and whistles, but it does a great job of cleaning. Good rack design allows for optimum loading. Runs much quieter than our previous dishwasher.
, Cleans well and is easy to use but don't lose the instructions manual because there are special programming modes based on key combinations! Construction is sturdy and very tight but I don't like how the water never really evaporates completely, leavin...
, This is an awesome dishwasher! Quiet and has everything you need to get those dirty dishes clean. Remarkable! I love it! Does it all...
, Dish washer works great. My experience with the installation wasn't the greatest. The company that is contracted to put the dishwasher in doesn't keep normal hours. They came to put the dish washer in at 10:45 p.m. They were supposed to be here between...
, I wish I hadn't been in such a hurry to buy a dishwasher after my old on quit!! This new Bosch is nice looking and that is where my saying anything nice ends! The inside is dark grey so it is hard to see inside. The racks are smaller than my old dishwa...
, Racks spacing is too small. The cleaning is unsatisfactory and does not dry well.
, I love this dishwasher. It's so quiet compared to my last one. So far it seems to clean very well. I read in earlier reviews some didn't like the way dishes are loaded in it, but I see no problem at all. This model doesn't have the sanitizing dry, but ...
, This dishwasher is from Germany - who must use much smaller dishes than we do. The bowls have to be stacked every other slot - so you can't fit as many in there. Then they touch the salad plates in the next row. It's also hard to fit pans in, with the ...
, I bought the Bosch Ascenta on sale last week, and Best Buy was offering free installation on Bosch dishwashers. It was delivered today and easily installed. I ran it once today. It is very quiet and cleaned the dishes very well. I allowed the dishes to...
, I bought this dishwasher 5 months ago. I first purchased a Samsung but it would stop working after 5 minutes. I tried a few times to get it working and decided it was not worth the hassle.. Best Buy gave me no problems exchanging it for the Bosch. I am...
, This dishwasher is SO quiet! It's running right now, a few feet from me, and I can easily hear my typing over the dishwasher. We can run it while we're sleeping, something we couldn't do with our old one. It gets everything very clean, too. Very good d...
, dishwasher is way too small - did not fit properly in standard place for same - leaks - returned to store - GE to be delivered per advice from installer
, The Best Buy sales guy raved over this unit - boasting of it's reliability and quality. In retrospect, I wonder if he was just trying to fill quotas. Needless to say, we are very very disappointed we bought this unit. Often it fails to release the soap...
, I chose this dishwasher for two reasons: Consumer Reports' high rating, and the price was reduced and included delivery, installation and haul-away of my old dishwasher. So far I am very pleased. I have only had it for a few weeks. It is ultra quiet! I...
, Well-built, quiet, cleans effectively, looks very nice.
, We bought this dishwasher because it claimed to to be real quiet and it was the lowest price at around 50 dBA...since our kitchen opens up into our family room we were looking for a quiet machine. It totally lives up to our expectations and does a grea...
, I was disappointed when I realized it does not have a heated drying cycle or a hard food disposal. But it does a great job and is very quiet.
, This is a great dishwasher. I was concerned about some of the reviews stating the dishes didn't get dry. However, if you use the Auto Wash plus Sanitize option and rinse aid like recommended the dishes come out just as dry as dishwashers with a heating...
, This is definitely not as nice as our old dishwasher that broke. Unfortunately we couldn't afford another one that nice. This one works great at getting the dishes clean and it is very quiet and fast. The things I don't like about it are that it is sma...
, The salesperson misrepresented this product. He told me that although there was not a drying element, the dishes and the inside of the machine would be totally dry as long as I left the dishwasher closed until the cycle was complete. Not true. I end up...
, This is a great dishwasher. It's very quiet, dishes come out very clean and almost dry.
, Very quiet and cleans dishes and silverware well. Best dishwasher I have owned.
, If I had waited and saved more money I would get a better dishwasher.
, This is a great dishwasherl.. Looks nice. cleans well. and quiet and less than $600.00 installed with parts...
, I did not give my new Bosch dishwasher 5 stars on the features line for one reason. The only thing this dishwasher does not do is put the dishes back on the shelves in my kitchen. I am hoping....some day. The Bosch is replacing a 43 year old Maytag. Th...
, Looks good, works great, would highly recommend if they could make the trays have better ergonomics, otherwise I only kinda recommend.
, Like the machine but is very basic for a Bosch. No rinse cycle which I didn't realize when I bought it. Doesn't dry everything completely and the racks seem to be very light and run off the tracks easily. It does wash well and is quiet and if all you n...
, Great dishwasher. I'm very pleased. It is very quiet! So much better than my old dishwasher.
, Great value! Very quiet, and great cleaning! I would buy again.
, Very good product that was featured as on sale with free install. It was an easy decision.
, We got this dishwasher for an outstanding price because it was an open item. My husband thought he could install it which was a nightmmare but that has nothing to do with the dishwasher itself. It is so quiet when it runs I forget it is even on. The to...
, I took a chance and we could not be happier. you do not have to spend a lot to get get performance.
, Have not found anything yet still getting use to loading it
, my old washer was not working properly....we were going to hire a plumber to see if the problem was water pressure but found that with this new washer we didn't need the plumber! We also didn't need the new electric hook up.
, i admit, the dishwasher i replaced was a 30 year old whirlpool. it still worked but was literally falling apart. i am thrilled that it no longer sounds like i am washing a rock collection. any thing on the market now would be quiet in comparison. that ...
, We returned this item for a Kitchen Aid! Rack set-up was weird and didn't hold our dishes well. It's a little smaller both inside and out so there was a gap around the edges and it didn't hold very many dishes. Heard after we returned it that it is the...
, This is a great dishwasher ~ exactly what I was looking for. and at a great price.
, This is a good buy, especially on sale. It cleans well and if you use the recommended Jet Dry liquid agent, your dishes will come out spotless.This unit is pretty quiet especially if you compare to othes on the same price range. The only thing I have i...
, Very nice dishwasher for the price. Very quiet. Nice, sturdy features.
, The sale price of this Bosh was exceptional, when you consider all of the features, and quiet rating, it was an easy purchase. I had read several reviews before I purchased, including CR, and there were some complaints of wet dishes, or just not drying...

, We got this GE micro along with Ge indiction range. They make a great combo and serve as a double oven set for my small kitchen. No problems so far, use it like a MW mostly but have baked cookies in it and they came out perfect. I will put it to the...
, This microwave operates as a wave and as a convection oven. With my matching stove that has two ovens, I can bake any number of different temperature items.
, This is so much more than a microwave I love the fact that I can bake a cake In this oven of I need too. It is really A great oven
, I've never seen a microwave oven with a dial control before. This is very weird in my opinion, plus the fact that you can only select 15 second increments for the microwave. We've had to adapt by selecting more time and watching the clock to shut off...
, When we remodeled the kitchen in our home, we were seeking a less expensive microwave/convection oven than the GE Advantium we had in our previous home. This new model fit the bill and it looks nice too. Hope it will give us years of trouble-free service.
, You have good prices on everything, only the words in reference to no sales tax that say but not in NY are a little hard to see.
, This is my first GE product ; so far , so good. My Sharp microwave/convection bit the dust after 20 great years; i wanted a larger oven so I went with the GE. Item arrived in a fairly timely manner; no problems.
, Have only been using this microwave for about a week but have found it to be excellent.
, After 4 months of minimal use, the turntable began to growl and jerked as it turned. Called repair and they have to replace the turntable motor. We were also cautioned about the dial saying there had been quite a few service calls because the threading...
, I bought this as part of a kitchen upgrade. It was a bit of a pain to install (just myself doing it) because it is a bit heavy but in the end it was securely mounted to the wall above my range. I like using the know to make the cooking selection but...
, The machine is good working machine in general, but our experience showed that we needed 3 repairs in the span of 2 months
, We had this microwave for about 4 month.Like the looks and the stainless inside and out.It is very easy to clean.From the very beginning the door did'nt seem to work right.During the cooking time it would suddenly pause.We finally called the repairman...
, This is a great combination of microwave and convection. It comes with a great cookbook that helps me learn to use the combination methods of cooking.
, This microwave/convection oven works great for us. Fairly easy to program and use. Like the stainless interior, better than porcelain surfaces to clean. Also like the exhaust fan, it works very well.
, despite having to learn how to used all the features ;this product performs very well ;although removing hot items from the cooking racks is precarious since the door lacks a detention and swings closed making you dodge hot surfaces
, Replaced an old counter-top microwave with this over the range microwave. Installed it myself (a little tricky but not too hard). We love the dual functionality of using it as a convection oven as well as a microwave (so, now we have two ovens and...
, We replaced all of our GE appliances with updated GE appliances ~8 months ago u2026 All have disappointed us. First, I have to agree with another reviewer that the knob control is stupid. Really, just poor design ... While we have not had any...
, Right out of the box, this unit did not work. I had to call GE repair within 20 minutes of installation. After waiting a few days for them to arrive, turns out there were wires inside the unit that were not properly connected at the factory. Once...
, Great features, but poor quality and parts to expensive. Our oven needed repair after 13 months because of poor quality from the factory.
, My wife and I were very pleased with the operation of this appliance. It is easy to program, inspite of the unusual combination button and knob. I was a little miffed at the installation. I was replacing an older GE over-the-stove spacesaver microwave...

, Reading reviews say so much to help in the everyday use of products so I go there first. Let me agree this product deserves five stars. Use, appearance, and price are excellent. It gives me a second baking oven for Holidays, and allows the micro...
, Used this product for several years. Don't like the 15 second increments. Bought this model to have more oven/baking capabilities. It does a great job with the convection baking and roasting. Don' t know how I managed holiday dinners without it.
, We have good lighting in our kitchen, yet the control panel is barely readable. The characters should have been much more prominent (for example, white, not gray). The instruction manual does not do a very good job of explaining how the settings should...
, Great for fast microwave and convection oven use or utilize both at one time to speed cooking time. Highly recommend this microwave convection oven.

, This microwave - convection works well in all operations.
, I had read several reviews on line of other convection oven/microwaves. Everyone had a problem with operation, power, or size. One that routinely came out at 4-plus stars was the GE Profile model. My wife was at first luke warm at the idea. Mounting...
, We use this unit every day. It microwaves with the best of them, but the convection oven is terrific. With only two of us, it cooks everything we need for dinner and does a great job.
, Microwaves are great to have in a kitchen. To have one that bakes, roasts & has a convection feature as well as micro/convection combination cycle is just downright marvelous. This oven will soon become indispensable. You will wonder what you did...
, I read the reviews before I bought, so I pretty well knew what I wanted. One review said the knob was the one thing they didn't like and it stuck out and made no sense. Well not in those words. I was a little weary and I thought it was strange when I...
, We were tired of having microwaves go bad on us. We had a GE Profile and then a Samsung go bad on us. So, this time we decided to get the maximum extended protection and installation as well. The product looks great and seems to work well as well. Howe...
, Overall this a very good microwave. We have not been using the convection feature too much. The controls require some extra manipulation to do basic things, such as: You must choose time-cook, twist the dial for time, press the button to select the tim...
, I really like this Microwave, easy to use. It looks great also. The only thing negative is the Control Panel is very hard to read especially at night. At night if you don't have a bright light on in the kitchen you can't even read it. During the day it...
, Replace an old double oven and vent with new range and over the range  microwave/convection bake/vent  unit.  Easy to install , works great!
, We rely on this product to use every day many times a day.   It looks great and performs well. I am very happy with the price and the shipping. It was just as I expected, maybe more.
, I have to start by saying we got the unit for a great price out of the box and used reward points towards it as well. With that said, the unit works very well. No you can't set the timer in less than 5 sec increments but who really cooks in anything el...
, Bought it, put it in and my wife baked a cake using the convection oven. AWESOME!!!
, I've owned this item for only a few weeks. So far it works perfectly but I've only used it to zap frozen entrees and boil water. The vent and surface light work well also.
, I'm far from a gourmet chef, but it looks great and have used it several times, very happy with the purchase.
, So far it works well convection works good and cooks even, I would recommend this Microwave
, I don't see anything wrong with it so far. I haven't used the convection oven yet. I heard it is great to use during the summer time when you don't want to use your oven. The only weird thing about the microwave is the big knob. It adjusts the time to ...
, Nice looking microwave with a convection oven. Works well and heats food up nicely.
, I have had this GE Profile Convection Microwave for over five years and LOVE it. It's never had any problems, never needed service, and it actually bakes cookies, pies, cobblers, cakes, and cooks chicken, stuffed mushrooms, casseroles and more to perfe...
, Just as we expected.  Attractive, easy to use, and reliable.  However, after two months the turn table inside has started to clunk as it turns.
, This is a very strong microwave when it comes to microwaving, but the convection oven/fast cook has a lot to be desired. It takes a tremendous long time to heat up. So much so, that on smaller dishes, it is actually just as fast in the conventional oven.
, Easy to program. Has book to teach you how to change cooking times for fast bake / broil features. Mic. wattage seems less powerfull than the posted 900W. Auto-cook features work great. Drawback would be stainless steel requres a little more detail in ...
, I love this unit. It looks great, it works great, love the convection oven. Use it much more than my big oven.
, Good oven for cooking a meal. But not so for short warm ups or reheats. You have to keep pushing the micro cook button to gain 30 seconds at a time. I wish it had buttons with numbers to add more time.
, I purchased my first GE Profil convection microwave in my new house in MI. After I sold the home and left the oven, I had to buy my second for the new home in VA. I highly recommend this oven to all my friends.
, The taste and texture of baked goods from the convection oven is awesome. The selection knob gives easy access to the full feature set of microwave and convection oven options. The only con so far, is that we have to wipe the touchpad frequently becaus...
, easy to install, have to go through to many steps just to use the microwave

, Overall a good freezer. It keeps things organized better than a box freezer. Also I really like the light on the outside of the freezer. My box freezer was going on and off without us knowing it.
, Plugged it in and within an hour I had frozen meats in without an issue.  No problems so far.  Quiet and seals tightly. Delivery guys were great.
, Bought this freezer because of the great features. I also bought the extended warranty. Started failing after about 6 months, have been dealing with Whirlpool and A&E appliance repair. Not helpful or professional. They can't get the part in, and don't ...
, Purchased this item less than two months ago and came home to a complete mess after work. Yes it was plugged in, and NO the door was not open. While we were throwing out an entire freezer full of meet, the freezer did not even attempt at trying to run....
, Good, small, reasonably-priced freezer. Like the light to tell it is on - I can do a quick check morning and night when going through my garage.
, Had a Gibson for 35 years. Hope this one lasts as long. Frozen OJ doesn't stay frozen in the door tray. Probably because no air circulation in door trays because the bottoms are not vented. Cold level is on 4 as per instructions Food on shelves are fro...
, We have had this freezer for a couple of months now. We really love it. Its a good size for a family of four. Its not super quite but quite enough and since we have it in the garage, we don't hear it anyway :)
, This upright freezer was received brand new in May 2013 by July 2013 the freezer's timer malfunctioned and frosted the entire interior. We got it serviced through warranty and it has been working fine since. Other than the initial issue above the freez...
, This freezer is so quiet and retrieving my frozen food is a breeze! I know what I have at a glance, and don't end up going to the store to buy another package of chicken breasts when there are 3 already in the freezer. It is so much more energy efficie...
, I shopped for a freezer for about 3 months doing a lot of research. This has been by far an excellent freezer and for a good price. It is very attractive, which was necessary because it is in our family room. It is quiet and love the feature of the war...
, we like our new freezer very much. I like the safety feature of the red light at the bottom which indicates that the power is on and frig is working. the design and look of the freezer is very nice. we keep it in our garage as an addition to our kitche...
, This freezer is extremely quiet and very functional! We are very pleased with it. There are so many other more expensive freezers on the market that are not as reliable or quiet as this one. We LOVE it!
, I like this freezer. i like the positioning of the air vents, and the'shelves. The only negative is mechanical. The door handle, and the bottom kick plate tend to fall off without warning.
, Great freezer. Great amount of space for food overflow and 20lb bags of ice. I hunt and make food in batches so it works great and keeps food frozen with ease. I was not sure about the size at first, kept thinking if I should go bigger, but I have a fa...
, The basket drawer in which I keep frozen vegetable packets and similar foods is okay and a good idea but it is cheaply made so that it comes off the runners at the slightest provocation.
, I bought this freezer to replace my old chest freezer. I can't believe how quietly it runs and how much usable space is inside! The shelving is logically spaced, and the door pockets are deep and fully usable. It's very energy efficient. I'm very happy...
, Very easy to use and had no problems the first six months. Then the timer failed and everything in my freezer thawed! Good service with the one-yer warranty, but would definitely recommend getting the extended warranty on this product. Great use of spa...
, Three times this freezer drain has frozen with ice till water ran out the door. I removed all food let it thaw out and started again. I have made sure not to block any vents. if I move food any further from vents I will have a 1 cubic foot freezer inst...
, Worked fine for about a month, then temp. raised. Needed a service call to re-seal the door (manufacturing defect) and replace temperature defrost sensor.
, We've had this for about 2 months and are very satisfied with the overall performance.
, I gotta say, this freezer works perfectly for my needs. It makes little noise when running and I haven't once had any frost on my food and I've had this freezer for almost a year now. I have the freezer in the same room as my furnace and washing machin...
, We have not had any issues with this freezer. The capacity is great for our family of 4--we buy a quarter cow beef and chicken in 40lb boxes routinely and freeze summer veggies. The door space is great for soups, etc. and the basket at the bottom is pr...
, We like the size for extra storage of food in the garage. It is quite.
, After reveiwing many other brands of freezers I always came up with the Whirlpool mostly because of the light and alarm feature and the changeable door from left to right which was important to me. I have owned washers, dryers, refrigerators and freeze...
, Dislike the way the lower basket is supported. Engineering could design a better mechanism to support the removable basket. The shelves in the door need to have the circulation openings at the bottom of the shelf closed up enough to keep thin items fro...
, I was highly disappointed with the Whrilpool freezer. There was a problem with the defrost feature that caused my food to defrost. I had to have the repair man out on a Saturday morning. I lost all of my frozen waffles, rolls, bread and ice cream. We d...
, This was a good price. Nice and quiet. Our electric bill did not go up. We had an old freezer, not frost free. This one is great. I highly recommend this freezer!
, from the time, we purchased the freezer, about a month, it has worked well, no complaints
, Surprisingly, this new freezer makes the same noises that prompted us to retire our old freezer for a new one.
, It fits perfectly in the spot that I picked for it.. It's large inside and has enough racks for plenty of storage.
, I bought this unit to replace an older model that had a crack in the case(kids dropped something inside). It seldom runs, is quiet when it does and my electric bill is lower because of it. I highly recommend Whirlpool over any brand.
, We purchased this freezer in August of this year - 2011. We were impressed with how quickly it got cold. We were really impressed with how well it maintained its temperature during a recent 3-day power outage we had at the end of September 2011, just...
, V Bono Arkansas 8/11 I purchased this freezer from Lowe's and needed a freezer with a left hand door. Lowes sales list and Whirlpools sales list say the door is reversable. The delivery guys reversed the door and worked for an hour trying to get the...
, Other than taking a month to get after being told it would be delivered in 2 days the freezer is everything they advertised. Not sure about how it will effect the power bill yet. It is a bit loud, but overall it seems to have been a good buy for the...

, This product has worked extremely well for my family, and I am impressed with how quite it is.
, Enjoying having the extra freezer space so I can take advantage of bargains and have a place to store extra bread products that don't get used up in a couple days. Seems to run fairly quietly although I have it in the basement so wouldn't hear it anywa...
, The shelves are designed much better than my old Whirlpool Freezer
, Does everything a freezer should, no complaints. Easy to use, quiet, lots of space.
, Have owned this freezer for about 4 months. Have had no issues at all, not that I should in such a short amount of time. There is ample space and I do not find this freezer noisy. Would buy again.
, This freezer is easy to use, freezes quickly and does not add to much to the electric bill.
, Good buy! We needed more freezer space, and this solved our problem. Quiet, simple, and tons of space for what we're storing.

, I am very happy with this dryer although I was a little disappointed with the steam cycle. It wasn't as effective as I would have liked in removing wrinkles from a shirt. I still had to iron it.
, My new dryer - LG - SteamDryer 7.3 Cu. Ft. 12-Cycle Ultra-Large Capacity Steam Electric Dryer - (Graphite Steel) - is a great, efficient, fast dryer. It has so many different cycles to choose from and easy adjustable settings to fit any load. Needless ...

, Despite having every feature you would want, it is very easy to use. It's like a modern jet passenger plane that can land itself. It is solidly built and quiet. The controls mirror those on the LG washers so it's easy to learn to use. The wife is picky...

, Would recommend this dryer to anyone wanting a front load dryer. Very quiet. Dries clothes fast. Love the settings
, A fantastic product. We enjoy all of the various functions and look forward to using the True Steam setting.
, The large capacity saves time and money. It dried sheets and towels efficiently and then sang a little tune for me. I often partially dry clothes and then hang them. The start/stop button makes this easy. The controls are easy to use.
, This dryer is much more than a standard dryer. It has settings that promote better health by reducing allergens. The quality of the product is outstanding. I like the ability to have so many settings for different situations.
, I was pleasantly surprised to learn I was going to be able to use the steam setting as my washer & dryer do not sit next to each other. I love how quick the drying is. Highly recommend this dryer.
, We were a little nervous about going to a front load machine from conventional ones, but this machine has changed our minds. Our clothes come out cleaner than ever before and the steam feature is nice. Not to mention the look cool in our laundry room!
, This is a great looking machine. The graphite color compliments the recent laundry room renovation. I especially like the steam and no-wrinkle features and the removable shelf that I can use for sweaters and other delicates that I don't want tossed aro...

, Purchased the dryer 2 months after purchasing the LG washer. The sanitation cycle works great. Drys cloths very quickly with large capacity loads. Steam feature is awesome.
, I work at a bank so how my clothes look is important! The steam option is great!!! Love my LGS!!!!!
, Nice controls. The chimes are cure. The dryer works very well.
, Great product
, Dryer works very well with moisture sensors that will reduce dry time if needed. Even though it is expensive, it was worth the money.
, This thing is amazing. Very fast, less energy. We have used it like crazy steaming pillows, drapes.... It's fun to use
, Love every single part of this amazing machine, especially when combine with the washer! Cant go with the melody when done.
, I actually like doing laundry now! This dryer thinks of everything for you, including how long the cycle will take depending on the size of the load. I love the song at the end of the cycle and my clothes come out dry and unwrinkled. I can fit so much ...
, Very nice and quiet dryer. Only issue the sensor drying sometimes stops about 15 minutes early!

, Love the steam function on the dryer less trips to the cleaner to have my clothes done.

, Cold not be happier. From features to drying time to steam. Using it all and enjoying doing laundry again! Seems like I just put it in and next thing I know it is ready to be folded. Loving the washer/dryer combination!
, I purchased both the dryer and washers and they both work great.
, We have had this dryer for a little over a month and it has exceeded expectations. Once we figured out how to do everything we have been extremely happy. It handles all the different types of clothing we have.
, This is a great dryer. Defiantly worth it's value. It's always quite and the steam dry works great. Many different options on it to choice from.
, We have had our dryer for over two months now and I do not know how I lived with out it before. I now do not mind doing laundry and it dries so very quickly.

, The best dryer we have ever had. Does an excellent job and is very effective. Would recommend to anyone.
, I just got rid of 7 yr whirlpool dryer. I do massive amounts of laundry and this is the best. Best dryer. Old whirlpool new never did this great brand new!!! Won't regret this if you are a mother if 4. Excellent!!!
, This unit is the perfect companion to our LG washer. Dries quickly and is a very quiet machine. Very pleased.

, It has great capacity. Love all of the features. Super quite.
, Very happy with it. Dries well. Lots of features. Energy efficient. Would recommend the drawer underneath to raise it up a bit.
, Thus far we are pleased with this Dryer. (We've had it for about 1 month) It is significantly better than the one it replaced as far as drying clothes is concerned. It has numerous cycles and all kinds of drying/cleaning options. Realistically it is pr...
, we really like this, it was top rated by consumer reports. would recomend
, So far tjhis is the best dryer we have had. It is quiet and dries quickly.
, Excellent product. Loads of useful features. Pretty quiet. Gets teh clothes dry without overdoing it--I don't use any-static or fabric softener products and don't miss them. I really like this dryer and the steam feature is a nice addition.
, so fast at drying large loads and things are not wrinkled at all
, This is greater dryer. It has steaming nozzles to help prevent clothes from wrinkling. It is fairly quiet
, It is overall a great product.It is very very easy to use.
, Like how fast and efficient this dryer is. Thankful that the signal can be turned off as the tune is cheesy.
, This is a great dryer. The sensor dry usually required me to switch over to time dry to get the clothes dried. I has lots of options; however, if you stack them, they are hard to read and I am normal height. Also, don't use the steam cycle to get any m...
, This dryer is the bomb. Looks great when matched up with corrisponding washer and sitting on it's pedistal. I researched it a lot and was very comfortable when I bought it and it hasn't disappointed me. Haven't used the steamer yet so can't comment on ...
, The dryer works very well. It can dry a good size load in as little as 40 minutes. The two things I don't like is that large size loads tend to come out wrinkled. (On normal setting) I have also been setting the dryer on more dry to get it to complet...
, I bought this as part of a matching set to replace an aging Maytag washer and dryer. It works perfectly. I would suggest waiting for the next big holiday sale. I picked mine up on the 4th of July and saved a lot of money. I installed it myself with no ...
, We really enjoy getting the best of both worlds, are energy bill has gone down as Drastically as we can now dry our king size comforter at home now! Awesome! Recommended!!!
, Purchased this dryer due to a Consumer Reports article I had read. I have not had any issues with this dryer and would recommend to anyone looking for a front load dryer with many features. Dries clothes very quickly.
, Reduce time, stress, and costs with this dryer. Censor technology dries clothes the perfect amount of time. Time to dry is roughly cut in half. I bought the corresponding washer at the same time, which I said I would never do, but best decision ever....
, I love this dryer. The drying time has cut in half. Love all the features. I have not tried the steam cycle yet, but am sure that is just as good as the other cycles. Also, the end of cycle tunes are great!!!!
, Love this dryer. Drys faster, quieter and more wrinkle free than the one I got in 2004.
, I have not had to repeat a dry cycle on even the largest load of clothes. I am satisfied with the dry time and the thoroughness of the dry. I don't like the motor sound (maybe it's the drum starting up) on the start of the dryer... it sounds rough.....
, Easy to load from matching washer, great height if on storage drawer, pleasant signal when cycle is done, perm press is great cycle, energy saver definitely!
, I LOVE my new dryer and all the options I have compared to a traditional dryer.
, I like the dryer, but I haven't used all the features yet.
, Got this dryer with matching washer. Just like the washer,the dryer is perfect. Love them both.
, I was very pleased with purchasing from US-Appliance. The dryer was the best price around, and was notified of arrival time. The LG3470 dryer handles the large load size from my LG3470 washer and dries rapidly. It has a large range of cycles, but most ...
, Finishes at the same time as our washer, so no waiting. The steam option lets us throw in wrinkled clothes in the morning and call it ironed. The capacity is equal to our new washer, so cycle time is much faster.
, Very fast dryer. The sensor dry is the only way to go. Works as well as a replaced 13 year old gas dryer and the clothes are done in a fraction of the time from the old appliance.
, Was disappointed with this product - my expectation was that I could dry & put away - this is not the case - have tried many settings & still need the iron
, Purchased this dryer based upon consumer testing and reviews. We have been very happy with it, and use the steam feature regularly to freshen folded clothes.

, When my old tried and true Kenmore Washer (circa 1994) finally gave up the ghost after 18 years, my appliance repair man recommended I buy a Whirlpool. I bought this model # WTW4850XQ because it looked impressive and it was on sale. It was an agitator,...

, We were using a refrigerator from 1990, so it's been great to have a modern, beautiful appliance.
, I Love This Refrigerator More Each Day...Thrilled To Own It
, We looked at ALOT of refridgerators before buying this one. We have had it over a month now and love it. It has alot of room and the ice maker is great,and being energy star is a plus. LG is a brand we trust as we also have the LG steam washer and drye...
, Very nice fridge with everything you need. Would recommend it 100 percent.
, best fridge I have had, only one that can keep up with our ice needs. also, the ice bin is NOT in the door and large enough.
, This is pricier than it's larger model, but, like in my case, if there is limited room, this will work best. Noiseless operation, and sleek looks make it a good purchase.
, This is a great refrigerator! Lots of room, excellent value for the price!
, Love this fridge, Roomy, great ice and water dispenser. Only down side is the lighting. If you put tall bottles on the top shelf, the light gets blocked from the rest of the fridge
, I got it at a great price, but i do think the control panel (for water /ice/ temperature) is too simple. It has good space and compartments.
, I like the refrig ,the only problem is the control panel in the front, the lighting is bad otherwise it is good
, I've had my new refrigerator for a couple of weeks now; so far I really like everything about it except for one thing. The lock-out control for the digital control pad not only locks out the freezer and refrigerator temperature controls, but it also lo...
, The one person who had to be happy of course is my wife; she's happy - what else matters?
, Our family refrigerator died on a Saturday morning and we knew we could buy another refrigerator over the weekend but were worried about the food in the broken unit spoiling because we thought we couldn't get a new unit delivered until Monday at the ea...
, We've only been using this refridgerator for a couple of months and are still getting used to it. So far it has been good. There have been no issues performance wise and the space works for our needs. We love the extra tall water dispenser, which is on...
, Overall, this refrigerator is great! The only drawback I can mention are the controls on the freezer door. It would definitely be better if the controls were in a more inconspicuous place. At least make the lock out feature more versatile, allowing the...
, So far this has been the best purchase of a refrigerator that I have purchased. The style and features are exactly what I was looking for. The fact that now I do not have to put ice in my milk is a great asset about this purchase since I have the abili...
, For the price, its above average, quite, makes ice fast, lots of door storage, love the tall despenser, would be easier to fill water bottles if fill tube stuck down a little more
, LG HAS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! Let me start by saying I have a ridiculous amount of patience and respect for people and companies, but this is one company that has pushed me over the edge. I have waited on the phone for over an hour numerous time...
, I like it much I was all I needed .the stove features were great . frig had good space
, This is a great fridge. The water dispenser and ice maker work real nice. Fridge is very spacious, and silent operation.
, Refrigerator works as advertised. First LG product and we are impressed with the quality. Ice maker keeps up with the demand for ice. Instruction and operating manual is very complete. Love the clean lines of the refrigerator.
, Overall, I think this is a good-looking and functional fridge. The fridge was slightly overpriced given its smaller size, but I am happy witht he fridge.
, When we decided on a side by side, I figured I was going to have to surrender some refrigerator room. I was pleasantly surprised when, not only did I not surrender space, but actually gained some. I just had Thanksgiving dinner and it was great that I ...
, I bought this when my family and I moved to a new area and it's been a great one!
, Love the ice machine on the door, the LED lighting, and how my food stays fresher longer. Roomy and easy to find what I need.
, Very easy to install and setup. Product so far seems energy friendly and like the door open warning!
, We had to purchase a new fridge after buying a new house. We like the space. It even has an alarm feature to let you know the door has been left open. Only two changes I would like... separate buttons for ice & water and larger ice tray. When the whole...
, so far its great, lots of room and the lighting is excellant, lets you see all shelves, not like the old ones.
, We recently remodeled the kitchen and purchased all LG appliances, after I ordered the fridge I read some negative reviews so I was some what skeptical about this model. So far it does what a refrigerator is suppose to....keep food cold. The freezer...
, I like this refrigerator a lot. The shelving is arranged to make food accessible and easy to see where it is located. A well thought our design. The delivery guys were great, they were very nice and did a great job during the delivery process.
, Hello, I am very pleased with the new Side-by-Side LG Refrigerator. I've had the refrig for a month and couldn't be happier. It is a very quiet appliance and has a very impressive appearance. I would definitely recommend this refrigerator to...
, Pizza boxes fit nicely without tilting in the refrigerator. All of our food has been cold or frozen. The ice maker is a bit noisier than our previous ones, but it's not too bad.
, Very nice, quiet fridge. Water dispenser is great for big water bottles
, We've had this for about 5 weeks now and so far worked well. Water and ice dispenser works well, plenty of room, good freezer layout. Only complaint are ice and water dislensed too fast (we went from one extreme to another) and no back lighting in the...
, This new fridge deserves an A- grade. The sound of it running is significantly quieter than my previous unit. And it keeps food cold in the fridge and freezer even set on a low dial. Ice maker is a bit clunky, but we're getting used to one another....
, I love it it is great and the features are wonderful, compared to my old one this one is great. the whole family loves it.
, After trying and returning three(!) different Sears Elite models and one Whirpool, we were relieved to come across this LG model, which more than met our expectations - in appearance, features and performance. The only minor drawback I could find are t...
, This refrigerator/freezer is just what I wanted, the only thing I have noticed so far is a small amount of condensation appears to form on the top lip of the freezer. I haven't figured that out yet, but will keep watching it. I'm thrilled with this ref...

, First time purchase of an LG product and I am very impressed witht the overall look and feel as well as the quality and workmanship of the product. I would definitley purchase additional LG products in the future.
, so far its great, lots of room and the lighting is excellant, lets you see all shelves, not like the old ones.
, This refrigerator is the perfect size for my family. I love the vegetable and fruit drawers. The ice machine works well. I just can't say anything bad, This is an awesome machine!
, We are very satisfied with this refrigerator. Very happy with LG brand. We are ready to purchase oven & cooktop and definitely considering LG. The ice and water dispenser works beautifully and is so convenient. Very good purchase.
, This unit is great, oversized opening in door for larger cups and pitchers. Temp controls on the front panel easy to read and use. Physical appearance pleasing to the eye
, We have had ours over a month now. Its extremely quite with lots of space. LG was a brand we wanted to look at because we purchased a washer and gas dryer from them and have been very happy with the results. We hope to continue with LG products and loo...
, keeps food fresher.great lighting.love the icemaker and large water dispenser.great refrigerator and freezer space.never run out of ice.wife loves crushed ice function.
, We are very satisfied with this refrigerator. & very happy with LG brand we have also purchased our washer & dryer. Very good purchase & fair price.
, Pros for this refrigerator are the LED lighting,pull out drawer, good sized ice maker, movable shelves, large capacity trays on inside of drawer. The cons would be louder than normal ice cube maker, would have been nice to have an egg tray. Overall, I ...
, its great i love this product the color the stile the feautures all
, Have had no trouble with this refrigerator. Icemaker works without clogging, Temps on both frezzer & refrigerator stay consistant! Love the look and performance.

, SO FAR SO GOOD HAVE HAD THIS FRIDGE FOR A FEW WEEKS, EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE TO SOON TO JUDGE BUT I'M VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE. THE ORIGINAL REFRIGERATOR I WAS LOOKING TO PURCHASE WAS A WHIRLPOOL. BUT WHEN THEY DELIVERED MY SS BOSCH DISHW...
, Good refrigerator
, We shopped around for the most fridge for our buck. the buck stopped on the LG. We loved the price the look and the features. Upon delivery and unpacking they found the fridge had been scratched. Not only did they return it at no charge to us but also ...
, Love my new Side by Side. I just wish that the ice despenser was better at dispensing into your cup and not in the floor and it would have been nice if they would have included an egg tray! Other than those 2 minor things it's been a great refrigerator...
, I researched a lot of consumer reviews and LG always came out to be the most consistent. The ten year warranty on the new style linear compressor was most impressive. The noise reduction system is also a plus. this refer has sharp looks, great efficien...
, Large capacity. Keeps items cold in the door. Ice maker works great and doesn't spit ice (especially crushed) all over the place when you use the dispenser. Interior lighting is easy on the eyes.
, Overall a nice frig. A little noisier than my old one but only when it runs. But I do like it's energy efficiency.
, I will NEVER buy anything LG again! I have had this fridge for 3 years and it has been nothing but trouble since the day it went out of warranty! I have had to have the ice maker repaired 2 times- and it still has never worked right. It leaks continuou...
, My family just finished moving and my parents purchased this fridge to replace our old and outdated one. What a purchase it was. The new fridge is down-right gorgeous! Boasting the LG logo, with its flawless stainless steel exterior. The inside has ene...
, Overall, the refrigerator functions well. However, it's been approximately 6 months and I continue to find defects. A scratch on the door, a broken piece of plastic, and another piece of plastic is cracking. LG customer service said these are cosmetic ...
, I bought this refrigerator 2 1/2 years ago. Nice size and looks. After 13 months the ice maker quit working. I had a repairman come to look at my stove and asked him to take a peek at the ice maker on the freezer. He disassembled part of it and said he...
, The water filter still taste 'plastic' after 3-4 days and hopefully it will finally goes away. The icemaker was a bit noisy when the ice 'made and drop to the container' but it's bearable. Setup was easy and the LED lighting is something I like. Else e...
, The inconsistent reviews made me a little weary, but so far our fridge is smooth sailing. Roomy freezer and fridge size, slide out trays, three drawers and adjustable shelves. Fits everything we need it to. Water and ice has a light and a few cube choi...
, Plenty of room in both sides. The built in filter is easy to replace and provides clear water and ice.
, Really good refrigerator for the price. Everything works as described. Just watch when you push the button for ice. Ice will catch you off guard if your not ready for it.
, While I have only had this refrigerator for 3 months I am very happy with this purchase. The quality of construction is much better than a famous brand I looked at before finding this one. The cost was about the same but the other brand had handles tha...
, ...but so far very amazing piece of workmanship. looks and feels solid when opening door, no rattles except for groceries. keeps everything crisp and cool as needed; still waiting to compare power bills from last summer, but so far saving a bit of $. l...

, Good quality at a reasonable price. And you can see every thing when you open the doors.
, I love my new refrigerator . It's got alt of room compared to my old one. Love the bottom freezer.will never go back to a side by side
, I like it, very good fridge. If the freezer was smaller, i would love it even more.
, This refrigerator has been great so far, we have only had it for a few weeks
, Spacious, interior design well thought out, bright lighting. Best thing: for our family of 7 my wife can fit her semi-monthly Safeway order all in the new unit. In the past we had to use our garage refer.
, We love how easy the freezer opens. Some of the other makers don't have the easy open drawer. Plenty of freezer space for pizzas and ice cream. You can adjust all of the fridge settings from the outside of the fridge. Would definitely recommend this pr...
, I absolutely love this fridge. I have room for all of my perishables. And it is so easy to stay organized.
, I've never bought a fridge before, but as a short person I liked the idea of a French door fridge. I got a great deal on the floor model, so of course there are the oddities that go with that (the doors can't be adjusted quite evenly, took a call to th...

, This unit replaced a Samsung and I must say I like it much better. One of the best features is separate ice and water dispenser. They work a treat. The additional ice storage bin provides all needed ice for any occasion.
, Great for the money. Love the french door style. Great bottom freezer storage capacity.
, Pros: This is a huge and wonderfully bright fridge, it will light up your whole kitchen. I really like the size of the ice cubes (they are smaller than average) and also like that there is an extra bin in the freezer to store ice. The water dispenser a...
, Love it. It's exactly what we wanted!! Lots of storage. Easy to clean, shows finger prints and smudges just like all stainless, but cleans up nice. Love the adjustable shelf and door shelves.

, Very happy so far, has met all our expectations. Works beautifully
, i love my fridge BUT next time i would get a different color due to how often i have to buff the doors down
, We have been using this refrigerator for just over a month and we couldn't be happier. It is everything you advertise it to be and more.
, This is a gorgoeous fridge inside and out. It is functional and has a lot of space. The only down side is the small ice maker. The trade off is a small icemaker for more space. When we have parties, we just buy a bag of ice and put it in the tub in the...
, We love this refrigerator. The only downfall is that the ice does get stuck in the bin on occasion.
, This brand was an excellent choice and I bought it band new and it has worked well. There is plenty of space, the shelves are adjustable ad so are the ones on the doors. Refrigerator accommodates drinks, milk and juices well on the doors. The refrigera...
, The refrigerator has a versatile layout with easy access and is well lit. We have frequently noted condensation forming on the inside edge of the doors but otherwise have enjoyed our refrigerator

, Very nice and spacious! This fridge has a little bit of everything from slimline ice maker to sliding shelves.
, I love this fridge. the water & ice are very quiet, & there is plenty of room. We have a family of four adults & haven't run out of ice yet. I do think the levers for the veggie bins should be level with the shelf & not stick up.
, This is the real deal. The interior is spacious and all the shelves/ledges/door slots make sense unlike some fridges out there that just don't make sense. You can easily place all your items in this fridge neatly and can see everything without losing i...
, The 31 cubic foot refrigerator/freezer is so well laid out for food storage. We like the LED lights that brighten the interior so the food is so much easier to locate. The ice cube storage could be somewht larger.
, Price is a little high. When they run a discount or sale, jump all over this fine fridge like we did... Second to NONE
, I absolutely love that the shelfs can be moved around to fit our needs and there are a tone of storage options in the freezer that maximizes the storage room. The energy saving options can be turned off so you can speed up ice production and you can ch...
, Love the product, have already raved about it to others.
, Performs well. This is a nice fridge for a modern kitchen.
, After spending 2700.00 on a refrigerator you feel totally ripped off to have a 500.00 repair bill one month after the two year warranty expires. I will NEVER buy another LG product. Buyers beware!!!!!
, This is a very roomy fridge with a good size freezer too. This is our first pull-out freezer, so we're still getting used to maximizing the space and accessibility. We sold our old upright freezer becasue of the capacity of this freezer, The flexibilit...
, We haven't used it much as we are still remodeling our home before we move in, but so far we have no complaints. Very quiet. Easy to adjust shelves for custom storage.
, We love this refrigerator. The ability to slide and move shelving and adjust storage in doors and freezer as well allows us to store almost anything from a large sheet cake for a birthday party to a watermelon or multiple jugs of juice and milk. We rep...
, Love my new refrigerator worth the the price! Got it on sale saved over $600. Always wanted a nice French door refrigerator. Finally got one. Went with LG because of 10 year warranty, did some research on LG and Samsung, Whirlpool. Went with overall be...
, I am very pleased with my purchase. It was a great value. The french doors are great. Also like the pull out freezer drawer.
, Really happy with the space and versatility of this product.  Everything fits nice and neat and it makes our kitchen look really good!
, I recently purchased this fridge to replace my old one. This fridge is beautiful in appearance and has a lot of storage space.
, The refrigerator unit looks premium with a nice stainless steel finish. The storage capacity is terrific, we've combined 2 previous refrigerators into one with this new one. Everything stored in the refrigerator is easily viewed and accessible. The wat...
, We bought this fridge when we moved into our new house and have used it for the past few months. Our whole family loves it!! Pros - - Large, spacious and ergonomically designed for a family of 4+ - Little details like the water dispenser stops when the...

, Overall a great product. Love the LED lighting. The design of the interior allows for easy visibility. There is great storage on the door. And the ice cube storage is in the door - very accessible. But the winning feature is the bottom freezer with 2 s...
, Good price when on sale, 1 month of service and the ice dispenser lid does not open properly all the time and ice get pile up and drips. Very quiet, big, good design.
, Looks really nice, but hard to clean. With the slim ice maker in the door, it takes away from door space. Doesn't make a lot of ice.
, This is a great fridge if you are looking for space and looks. I have a garage fridge and it is almost empty because most of the stuff fits in this 30cf one. The LED lighting and other temp. control features are great. The inner air filter is good for ...
, Used to have a counter depth 25 cu ft side by side. This configuration is so much more roomy and practical. Love that the ice maker is in the door and doesn't take up space in the fridge section. And 3 separate pull-outs in the freezer makes it so easy...
, This product replaced a Whirlpool Conquest, and provides considerably more refrigerator space, better interior lighting, and more freezer space. The ice maker performs well, and operation much quieter.
, We are pleased with the amount of space and the french doors. The drawers are deep and everything is easy to see even when the shelves are full. No hidden leftovers found in the back because we can see them now. The ice maker should hold more ice but t...
, Was hesitant to go with French door. But I just love it. It is so easy to find things and this model has 2 bins and a drawer. The lighting is awesome and the design inside allows me to see what is in there so much better than my old refrigerator. I als...
, I was so excited to remodel my kitchen 3 years ago! We shopped and shopped and finally decided on the LG refrigerator. Within the first year of owning it, the freezer fans stopped working and the ice maker broke. We had the repair man out constantly. S...
, Bought a GE french door originally and boy was that a mistake. Tossed out ice so hard it broke 2 glasses. Sounded like an airplane when compressor kicked on, and lights inside worked only when they decided they wanted too. After ordering the LG (along ...
, This refrigerator is roomy, stylish and very organized for efficiency and use. I especially love the water and ice on the outside. I am so glad we made the decision to buy this one.
, Love the stainless steel and easy of overall features. The space in freezer and overall refrigerator space and layout. Would recommend. to friends and family. We bought all appliances including washer and dryer. Love LG
, This is a huge change over our 15 year old refrigerator, not the least of which it has French doors, and hence the freezer on the bottom. Very nice for accessibility. The only unfortunate thing is it was a returned model, and as delivered did not have ...
, Awesome French Door refrigerator. Very sleek design that maximizes usable space.
, Since we are big freezer users, I nearly chose a large side by side instead. I'm very glad I purchased this model. It is extremely quiet, has an XL freezer with great drawers plus exceptional lighting. Easy to clean. My only complaint is that the ice m...
, So much space, I stopped using the fridge in the garage. The large drawer at the bottom of the fridge will easily hold a large pizza box! Down side is the fridge looks empty all the time. The ice dispenser is large enough to allow those 24oz cups to ea...
, Great fridge, was delivered on time and set up for me without incident. If you haven't seen these guys pick up a fridge with a belt then you're in for a treat. The water dispenser is my only complaint because you have to press really hard to make it st...
, Only issue we have to date, is that the ice cube compartment does not empty evenly and ice will become hard packed on one side. Dispenser also throws sprays of water as if not cold enough to completely freeze water. Must remember to empty ice cubes int...
, The Consumer Reports rating was the primary driver in our purchase of this product. We've had this refrigerator for about six weeks. The capacity is awesome and the features are a level beyond our previous refrigerator. We use the door-in-door compartm...
, We love this refridgerator. It is designed to maximize space. From the adjustable shelving to the ice maker design, it allows for ease of use and provides the ability to locate stored items quickly. We are very happy with the decision to purchase this ...
, This is a huge refrigerator and no space is wasted. Love that the ice is made but never seen unless you need to. All the space and being at your eye sight level is wonderful. I had a side by side before and you always have to look down or behind, in se...
, Great looking fridge, tons of room and very well organized spaces for lots of things. Great to have the 2 door freezer for frequently used items and longer term items.
, The French door arrangement with freezer compartment on the bottom maximizes storage space. This is especially true regarding the freezer compartment, compared to the side by side style where the vertical shelves consume too much space. The pullout she...
, I am very happy with my french door refrig. More room than expected. Easy to rearrange the shelving and door storage. LOVE the ice maker!
, We have had our LG french door refrig for about 2 months. Love the design, space and the lighting. There is so much room in both the refrigerator and freezer. My only concern is with the ice maker. I wish it was larger so that it held more ice. Yes I u...
, We love everything about it so far.. only thing we wished it had more room for taller items such as milk and juice bottles etc.
, I like to cook but hate to go to the grocery store. This unit has plenty of space so that I can get a whole week's worth of groceries at once and the unit will keep them fresh until needed. Despite its size, the fruit and veggie drawers are kind of sma...
, dents and scratches so easily needs to have fingerprints wiped of a lot size is great looks good most of the comments are about how large it is
, The LG fridge is a nice fridge for the price. As a brand I have never owned before, I looked it over pretty well to see how it compared to the Frigidaire I owned previous. A few things caught my eye, first not all of the shelves are 'spill resistant' s...
, We love the huge space, especially the storage in the doors. After rearranging a couple shelves, everything fits nicely for us. The bright lighting is impressive. The bins roll out smoothly and are easy to remove for cleaning. There's no stooping to re...
, We bought this refrigerator July 6th, 2013 and have had it for a little over 2 months. So far I am pleased with reservations: My biggest negative is the ice maker. This refrigerator does not come close to making enough ice for 4 people on a daily basis...
, This is the worst, makes no ice. Very slow. I can feel 4 ice trays (since we had to go that route in order to have ice) and fill the container in which they provided for freezer. I will fill the container before the ice maker makes enough ice to fill t...
, Love the size, look and sound. Ice maker and water dispenser are perfect. Lighting is way cool.
, Let's start with what's great about it because I do love this fridge: Lots of room in the fridge!! I'm loving the spacious area and Clear everything so that you can look all over and not miss any food! (I used to overlook many items that went bad in th...
, Like the lighting, interior space and layout. Do not like the incessant hum/noise that drives us upstairs to watch tv. Icemaker barely keeps me in ice on these 100 degree days, but I supplement with trays from outside freezer - not a real big deal.
, The led lighting is a major improvement because of overhead and front placement of lights. Shelves are easy to adjust. The ice maker never runs out of ice and we have not had any problems with ice freezing in the ice hopper. My only improvement suggest...
, Great refrigerator and very convenient for daily use. The only drawback is the small ice container. Does not produce and hold enough ice for a large family on a hot day.
, Have waited 7 years for a refrigerator with water and ice in the door and now I can't let things be in the freezer to long. I can see everything with the light on.
, The fridge is great for size and really helps with a house full of boys. Only problem we have had is with small stuff. A spring is damaged and causes issues with closing the doors and a control panel LED is out within 2 years of purchase. Other than th...
, Only complaint is the design of the shelving. If you don't want to put all your pitchers of tea, Kool-aid,... in the door, which may be hard for those kiddos not trying to spill a full one, then you lose quite a bit of shelving to accommodate these pit...
, I love my refrigerator. There is plenty of space to house lots of food. 3 bins for fruits and veggies with humidity control, a climate adjustable drawer big enough for serving platters, extra room in the door shelves for condiments in front of the milk...
, Overall very please with new fridge. I drink more water having filtered ice/water easily dispensed through door which I've never had before. Still love having freezer on the bottom since I'm taller, it puts more common food items right at eye level. Lo...
, The fridge is great. We are very happy with it. Lots of space, and it is efficient. Ice maker and water dispensor are convenient to use.
, Wonderfull fridge. Love the lighting inside...everyting is so easy to see.
, The ice dispenser and water dispenser work well; no messes. For our normal day to day living, the ice maker makes enough ice. We have to buy ice for parties and filling the cooler. The pull out bottom drawer freezer is a great size. the two drawers ins...
, I couldn't have bought a better refrigerator! We have a family of four and needed a bigger refrigerator, we loaded everything from our old refrigerator into the new one and it didn't even fill half of the new LG refrigerator! The LED lighting looks so ...
, LG has a great product with specially designed thin, extremely insulated walls. This means that for its size, this refrigerator has more interior space than most. Additionally, I love the fact that LG's ice maker is entirely incorporated in the door. D...
, I love how much space this model has and how well laid out it is. Even with the ice maker in the left door I still have room on the left for plenty of beverage cans. The Slide and Serve drawer is wonderful; it will hold a family-sized pizza, a large ...
, I just love this product.Very good look and easy to use.
, A large fridge with lots of modular storage space. Holds plenty of food for a family of 5 who love to cook!
, We owned an earlier model of this refrigerator, but when we remodeled our kitchen, we needed a new one. Our problem with the last LG was the drawers in both design and quality. We hated them. When it came time to buy a new one, we immeditaely looked at...
, I love this product. It is very efficient and I was not sure about the freezer on the bottom since I have never had one but I love it because you can store more food without wasted space like the side by side models. I also love having 2 refrigerator d...
, We are happy that we purchased this product. We are pleased with all the features and love using it.
, I really like that there is a lot of flexibility to move items around in this fridge. I like the 3 areas in the freezer making it easy to organize and access frozen food.
, Why did we wait so long! You don't know what your missing until switch to this GEM! This is one very nicely designed unit. Love the ice maker! It's just my wife and I and we use ice everyday all day and it keeps up without a problem. We love the French...
, What a great Refrigerator. It is the biggest one I have ever purchased and the only refrigerator that can fit an extra large pizza box in it with ease. It has so much room that believe it or not my wife has a hard time filling it up. Definitely will re...
, The refrigerator is the best one I have ever owned. Lots of space, energy efficient, icemaker and water dispenser is fantastic and takes no space in the refrigerator ! We use it many times everyday and because it is filtered, no need to buy bottled wat...
, After reading other bad reviews on this fridge I really had second thoughts, but after a couple of months it has worked flawlessly. It does have a few quirks, like if the ice holder is not used once a week it tends to clump up and will not dispense. Th...
, When shopping for a new refrigerator, I was sure I wanted the 4 door french door refrigerator. This refrigerator has all the same features and space as a four door and is much cheaper! The storage capacity is wonderful and it cools quickly and efficien...
, The ice dispenser easily clogs causing the ice to back up when trying to dispense ice. It is also slow on making ice. I usually just dump the ice from the tray in the ice maker into the big container supplied for the freezer.
, Someone who uses a refrigerator designed this one! Both the refrigerator and freezer are exceptionally well illuminated with no dark spots. The flexible configuration of the refrigerator meets all my storage needs. I'm short, but by putting bins on the...

, We have been the proud owners of our LG French Door Refrigerator for nearly 6 weeks. This fridge is as beautiful as it is functional. It is well lit, keeps everything in the fridge perfectly cold, and the freezer keeps the ice frozen but not stuck toge...
, We just bought this 925ST and actually really like it so far but there is one drawback a buyer should be aware of. The one deficiency, we have experienced, so far, is the ice maker. The ice maker's capacity is very limited. You absolutely have to keep ...
, I am somewhat dis-appointed with the ice maker, I had turn down to -4C for the temperature of the Freezer so it will make more ice. Does not seem logical to me so it will make more ice. Then you have to move to the tray below. When having any kind of e...
, I wanted the French doors and now after using it for awhile I still love the French doors. The water/ice being separate components is very nice as well.
, Did quite a bit of research prior to purchasing this refrigerator. Reviews and feed back from the various sites I reviewed were spot on. Capacity, features, looks, overall product quality, etc. are awesome.

, A great LG Fridge, with LG warranty, plenty of room and does what it says it will do quite well.

, Bought fridge with matching LG stove. Great pair, they look great really dressing up the kitchen.
, We had an LG french door for about 7 years but when we sold our house the new owners wanted the refrigerator. I can't blame them it was great. Recently purchased this model and love it even more. We didn't have the outside water and ice dispenser on th...
, We think his fridge is great, so much room in this thing. We were looking at the LG 28 cu. ft. fridges but went with this one becuse it had so much more space in the freezer and having the second tray in the freezer is a plus! If i had one complaint it...
, This is the first French door with a bottom freezer I've had and I love it. The refrigerator and freezer areas are so roomy I don't know if I'll ever fill them up (will find out for the holidays). The lighting is wonderful; it is so bright when you up ...
, Love this refrigerator, and I'd buy it again. Quiet, lots of space, well thought-out design interior. Only downside is ice maker capacity---make sure the included ice bin in the freezer is full before you have guests over who use a lot of ice. The in-d...
, This refrigerator has many great features including the phone service feature where the tech on the phone can check your refrigerator remotely. Because this is a new technology compressor it takes about 3 days from first start up to get the operating t...
, We researched all the refrigerators on the market and LG had the most user-friendly features of all. The storage bins have rollers and not only move smoothly when adding or removing products, but the ease of removing them to clean is untouched by all m...
, Love the ice maker & water. Nice full size pull out drawer that we use for meat. Three drawers for vegetables & plenty of storage in the doors. The quality is superb. Great lights inside refrigerator. Freezer has two pull out drawers for easy access.

, We've had this refrigerator for about 2 months and we love it. We really like the way the lights make everything easy to see - no more dark corners! Our boys are enjoying the crushed ice feature on the door. We had read the bad reviews about the ice ma...

, this is a very nice feature rich fridge...the drawers in the fridge &amp; freezer are very nice...a little pricey
, went from side by side to this...love the stainless steel. would probably buy this again. like being able to put large things in the frig side.
, We've had the refrig 1mo & have had nothing but problems w/ the ice maker/dispenser, leaking, clogging, not working or having to empty too often. Ready to place a complaint & service request for the issue. It's brand new!
, This is a great refrigerator. It had all the features that we wanted and then some more.

, Everything is easy to access. The freezer on the bottom is perfect
, We needed more storage space and this unit provides the space we needed
, This refrigerator is everything I hoped it would be and more. I have never been as pleased with an appliance purchase as I am with this product. My favorite feature is the size, it's huge, I have yet to fill it and I have a large family and buy a lot o...
, I like how much space it has compared to my old fridge. also it took some getting use to the bottom freezer but now that I have it I like it.
, This is definitely a big hit, not only with us, but the extended family members that come to visit & rave about it. There is so much room, shelves adjust to fit our different needs, the drawer space & large drawer is a great space. With the ice maker i...
, This is probably by the worst ice maker ever manufactured. I have now resorted to simply making ice and putting it the ice bin, which completely defeats the purpose of having an ice dispenser. Extremely disappointed in this fridge, and would not recomm...
, Nice design, great features, a lot of room, quiet!
, We traded our Kitchen Aid side by side and were amazed at how much more space we have with this new one! And it is the same space - fit our built in space perfect!  The  only negative is it does not make that many ice cubes as the dispenser is compact....
, It will hold anything. I had read reviews, comparisons, read the complaints on icemaker being slow/freezing up. Bought it, and we love it. This monster frig fits in the kitchen where a 22 yr old 22 ft3 side by side sat, makes ice without flaw, runs sup...
, The ice maker in this unit is the worst ever produced. It would very likely keep up with one person, who never entertains, and is gone 12 hours a day. However, if you are looking for a unit with an ice maker that is intended to work as an ice maker - k...
, Quieter than other makes,easy to use
, It has super lighting along with plenty of room for a lot of food that my old frig didn't have. I also like the humidity controls on the storage bins. The bottom freezer is so much easier to use then the upper one in my old frig.
, This thing is a beast! It is huge and so well lit! Pros: huge size, convenient access in both fridge and freezer, lighting, super-smooth drawers in fridge and the same for freezer drawer, outside controls are easy. Cons: The minor frost buildup on the ...
, Love the look, the LED interior lamps, adjustable shelf, wide door bins, adjustable temperature of the Glide 'N' Serve area, large Crisper section and especially the extra large storage within the freezer compartment. The only drawback is the indoor ic...

, Does a great job of keeping things refrigerated at the proper temp and especially the vegetable bins where items stay much fresher and crisper longer. We especially love the small pull out drawer at the bottom of refrigerator section for deli meats etc...
, After an extensive search, to replace all my kitchen appliances, I selected one brand for everything but the refrigerator. Once I saw this LG refrigerator, I had to have it. No other brand refrigerator on the market could compare and trust me, I resear...
, The LFX31925ST is an excellent refrigerator, however, I suggest the following improvements: 1. Water dispenser should be inside along with ice as it is difficult for children to hold the glass to fill. 2. The lower drawer should be split in two to avoi...
, This is a great refrigerator, lots of room, crisper drawers are roomy, and the freezer is great with the many compartments, very convenient and easy to get to. However, the icemaker is a problem. The ice gets frozen in the bin and won't dispense the ic...

, So far I have no complains. The Fridge is very roomy and runs very quuiet
, For the price this refrigerator is amazing. And the interior space if gigantic. Down side is it just fits in the opening in the cabinets.

, This unit actually fits better than the previous side by side unit but has provided more storage. Motor operates quietly, and the interior lighting is great. The appliance has a great exterior appearance.

, I did research on french door refrigerators for over a month. I looked at many brands and kept coming back to LG. This is the hands down largest and still the most attractive one I found. We are a family of five and have a secondary freezer for all...
, Spent a lot of time researching prior to purchase. I love the ice maker in the door and the adjustable shelves. The noise from the fan in the freezer is terrible. About once a week, the whole freezer needs to be disassembled to get to the fan, which...
, This refrig has to be by far the best one on the market today; you get what you pay for and so very much more! The room is unbelieveable in both the refrig and then the freezer compartments. You want cold milk, okay, but it you want nice cold milk that...

, This is a great fridge! TONS of space! I go grocery shopping and put everything away and my fridge still looks empty!
, We bought this frig in July 2011. I like the size. I do not like the milk on the door. It's kind of hard to get in and out unless you move another shelf which then takes away from being able to place taller items on the shelf you moved to make head...

, Like the unit, lighting and shelve adjustability. However, we checked and the water filters are $50 to replace, they should be more like $10. The stainless finish streaks when cleaning, even if using a cleaner specifically for stainless steel. Otherwis...
, We love this refrigerator. It is quiet and the filtered water is delicious. There is sufficient storage space. Smells fresh with great lighting. The crisper compartment keeps the produce fresher so that it lasts longer. We love our LG!

, Looks great and the price was good like LG is a good brand.
, Excellent Product, I have had no problems, it has a great bright and airy feel, plenty of storage space, I was a little weary about the SS, but it does clean up well..lol
, Humongous. So great for a large family you would think. Too bad the through the door ice bucket is TINY, less than half the size of a typical fridge designed in the US. Look elsewhere if you or your kids use a lot of ice. If that's not important: then ...
, Great design with sleek look. Plenty of room for all our storage needs. Great lighting enables you to find what you are looking for with ease. Easy settings and the door alarm is a great warning. Multiple ways to arrange the items in the doors and insi...

, would recommed this refrigerator to family and friends.
, Great ! ! Only had for 1 month, but love it so far ! ! Plenty of room and lots of light, plus I love the open alarm !
, We absolutely love this refrigerator! There is always plenty of space and the ice maker is built right into the door, rather than taking up part of the refrigerator space. Shelves are adjustable and has a built-in odor control. Very quiet and you can a...
, I bought this refrigerator because it was roomy, but for a $3000 refrigerator the outside display is simple, LG couldn't install a color display? Also the ice machine barely makes ice at all. I set at a negative 6 temperature still does not meet the qu...
, Originally bought the Samsung HARS Stainless Steel fridge, (4 door RF4287HARS) My wife and I were super excited for it. The Samsung was heavy (delaminated our floor tiling), Loud (low rumble every-time the variable speed compressor started and ran) the...
, I found the identical refridgerator at HOmeDepot for $500 more. My family loves this fridge. I'm not disappointed, at all, with this purchase. The guys that delivered it were especially friendly.

, We previously had a LG French Door refrigerator, but left it when we sold our house. When we bought a home in NC, we purchased an Electrolux. We bought into the hype that Electrolux produced superior products. Wrong. In the ten months we had it, it req...
, Very nice, well built, awesome lighting and functional refrigerator, and extremely quiet! The only thing is hope the area where you serve ice and water would not scratch, it is pretty much new and already shows a number of scratches from putting the gl...
, So far, so good. Bought it, went on sale within 30 days. Price warranty service was fantastic, quick and easy. Thank you Best Buy... I was amazed. The ice maker in the door is one of my favorite features. Also, keeps up with ice demands with no problem...
, First of all, I am not one that usually writes reviews so that should tell you how strongly I feel about the refrigerator. The freezer went out on our 10 year old side by side GE fridge so I started researching French Door refrigerators. This LG was at...
, So far I have no complaints. I love the large size of my refrigerator. The fruit/vege drawers work great. My lettuce stays crisp so much longer. I also like the freezer capacity and drawers.
, So far, no issues with the limited amount of ice I have heard. We always have ice but we dont have a large family of teens either. Love the space, it is quite and well lit. Highly recommended.
, Love this refrigerator. Plenty of storage. Especially love the large glide out drawer. Makes finding things so easy. Great storage space in freezer also.
, We bought this from our new house and love it! It is huge and makes great use of the space. The water dispensor is a little tricky and we have made a couple of messes when trying to fill a water bottle or something. Other than that, we have no real com...
, The refrigerator is great. It is nice to be able to see everything on the shelves. I wish the top shelves were able to accomodate 2 liter bottles without splitting the right shelf.. The top shelf of the freezer is great for ice cream and coffee cans, O...

, We had the 26.5 model and loved it. Built a new house and decided to go for the bigger model. Fits into normal space for a fridge but so much more space. The larger unit only sticks out roughly 2 more than the smaller. We LOVE it!
, I purchase this refrigerator a few weeks ago. I found that the ice maker does not make enough ice per day to fill two large glasses. If I new this before, I would not have purchase this refrigerator.
, We replaced our existing Whirlpool refrigerator with this LG stainless steel model. Although our former fridge was working fine, upgrading our kitchen to stainless meant a new fridge, too. We couldn't be happier with the LG. The space efficiency is rem...

, Saw this LG in the best buy store. i Loved the lights inside of it. It really brightens the entire inside. I like that I can open either the right of left refrigerator door if I want instead of having to open both. My husband loves the shelves in the d...
, I have had this fridge for less than a week, but that is long enough to know the the ice maker sucks. It makes baby size ice cubes at a snails pace. Even though I have it turned up to the extra ice mode, I have had to buy a bag of ice every day. The si...
, There is soooo much space in the refrigerator that it is hard to fill it up. The only drawback is that the ice maker is made completely in the door. This leaves a lot of extra space in the refrigerator, but takes away space for the amount of ice cubes ...

, We've had this for a month now, and still haven't filled it! Lots of room for vegetables and the big drawer on the bottom has three different temp settings. I don't like that they show all the ads with gallons of milk in the door, and then you get the ...
, We have had our refrigerator for 3 months and really enjoy it. It has a lot of storage. It also has a lot of lighting. We also like the ice and water on the door, which has room to fill any sized container. Water fills a little slow, but that may be ou...
, I am very pleased with the refrigerator. There is so much space that I have a hard time filling up the shelves. The crisper drawers keep my produce well past their expiration dates, and keep them in excellent condition. All foods in the particular area...
, 30 Days old and the manufacturere REFUSES to replace the product since its repairable. REALLY it shouldn't have broken after one month. This is what happens when you buy foreign products!
, We loved this refrigerator until now we have serious doubts. We paid a good hefty price for LG Brand and quality name. After 1 month, the fan is out; which shouldn't be. More importantly, we are disappointed in Best Buy's repair service ability to resp...
, This was not my first choice actually. It was the 27 inch model. This model fit into my kitchen space without any effort. My wife loves this refrigerator. She goes on and on about the space and the ability to store so much. Whole large pizza boxes fit ...
, I purchased this from Best Buy 2 months ago and am having so many problems with the refrigerator. It freezes up and shuts off. When we contacted LG the tech was very rude and unhelpful. We were told to unplug is for 3 to 4 hours and that should fix the...
, I just had this fridge delivered today and I am very impressed for what is in my kitchen. Looks way better in the kitchen than on the showroom floor. I must say the design of the fridge is also to be noticed with lots of space and real stainless steel ...

, Thiis is the best refridgerator we have ever owned. Everything works great and it has a tremendous amount of room. The water and ice maker are very nice and we have had no shortage of ice. If you want a big fridge this is the one to get.
, All in all it's an excellent refrigerator, large, spacious doors and interior. The controls on the door are great!
, This is the second LG refrigerator that I have owned the first was a lemon replaced with this model. The refrigerator had consistent freezing problems on the top level. The replacement refrigerator has water problems - water leaks from the ice section ...
, We've been needing a larger refrigerator and decided on this one. I especially like the freezer section with the large bottom section & 2 drawers that keep things organized. It's great
, Normally I wait for awhile before reporting, but I wanted to get this in quickly to help other buyers. The specs say the unit is 35-3/4 inches wide but it's larger as the unit 'bulges' out on the sides, so it didn't fit at first. We originally got a fl...
, Love the size but disappointed with ice maker. Shelves are adjustable and removable so super easy to clean.
, Water dispenser takes hours to cool the water to refrigerator temp and then only dispenses about 8 oz of cool water before it gets warm again. Not much cushion on the doors so they close hard, sounds like a 70's car door closing. Lots of shelves ...
, We love the capacity of this freezer; the indoor icemaker unit so its not taking up space in the refrigerator; the space in the door for large items such as gallon milk jugs; lights so you can see everything; no more forgotten items; the larger freezer...
, The refrigerator is nice and large but has some major design flaws. The icemaker jams up and then leaks, the freezer creates frost on everything. LG customer service is horrible. I have missed so much work having to wait for repairs. LG insisted that t...
, We got an amazing deal on this fridge. The drawers are very smooth and hold a lot. The grey sides don't really make sense, but it works out just fine. The front is non-magnetic which really doesn't make sense, but in the end it keeps us from putting st...
, Its a big fridge and takes up space, measure carefully. I have not had a problem with space. large space in freezer with 2 nice drawers that make organizing great. large doors make it great for big containers like milk. ice bucket seems small but I hav...
, After receiving the LG product the very next day we noticed that the top freezer drawer was covered with a thin layer of ice. Later in the week we called LG and they promptly sent out a factory repairman. He replaced the seal but after two more days th...

, Beautiful and functinal. Very happy with this product.
, I'd personally reconsider buying this LG 31 cu ft - regardless of sales. Myself and 2 neighbors have the same one and we've all had the same problems... It will break. Just a matter of time. Most likely in the first 8-10 months.
, Love the space! Ice had a hard time keeping up in the beginning but seems to be better now. Really no complaints about the fridge. Had some issues with Best Buy and their ability to get it delivered when they said they would but that has nothing to do ...

, This fridge is great! Really big and has a lot of capacity. Looks nice too.
, most impressed with large size, easy of access to food, interior lighting. stainless steel requires more smudge-cleaning; not a biggy, however

, My old side by side was dying and after reading the reports I decided to go with LG. Having the freezer on the bottom allows wide items that could never fit in the old one. Plenty of room in both the top and bottom. Love the in door ice maker, doesn't ...
, The only fault I have found with this product is the ice maker in the door. If you do not use ice for a couple of days you have to shake the ice container to get them to drop out of the shoot. Other than that this is well worth the money!
, This fridge is so large that we have trouble keeping it full! The flexible storage makes it easy to store even the tallest of bottles and unusual shaped jars. Large platters and even pizza boxes fit with plenty of room left over. The versatility of the...
, We were looking for a large refrigerator to put into a modern built kitchen. It fits our style , works well and is huge. The only weak point is the ice maker capacity but its design does allow for additional space inside. We like it .

Ft. Upright Freezer - White, DisplayName=, CommentText=[We like this freezer so far, it's nice and quiet, We bought it because our last freezer decided to go nuclear.
, I like the space,the shelves,the lock,the light,the outside temp. indicator
, Solid performance so far, good maintenance of temperature, drawers work well, the adjustable plastic shelf units for doors are pretty functional but there should be a few more of them.
, The best thing about this freezer is the exterior display which let's you know the temp inside. It also has a warning alarm to let you know if you left the door open or the freezer isn't working properly. that's means you will hopefully know before it'...
, Easy set-up(2 buttons ...Temperature and alarms are set). Easy access. Very spacious. VERY Quiet. Well illuminated.
, The freezer is a little noisy but not objectionable since it is in a separate room (laundry room) and is a lot quieter than the washer or dryer. The lack of a key for the lock is not a problem because we wouldn't lock it anyhow.
, Great frost free freezer with easy to use controls.
, Love my freezer. It has enough room to store a whole deer or a hog. Can't wait to fill mine with mutton!
, This item fits the situation I needed for additional frozen food.
, Good freezers are certainly not cheap so the real proof is in how long this unit will last. Early impressions are very good so far.
, Love that this freezer is frost free. Shopped around a lot and this freezer had the best features for the price.
, This unit replaced a 35 year old freezer that wasn't frost free. My wife was well pleased with the aesthetics and the functionality but most important to her was the frost free operation and the multiple temperature setting capability!
, Have had it less than 2 months. So far so good. Have concerns about about the operating cost.
, this freezer replaced my 53yr old one & I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner there's lots of room on the doors & the baskets give me even more room I thought it would be noisy as some reviews said but it's not & it fit in the space my old one was.
, We did not want a horizontal unit because we wanted the convenience of shelves and a door. This fit the bill, and was energy star as well. Everyone recommends filling it with water jugs until you fill it with food, and that's good advice, otherwise it ...
, It's a huge freezer that will fit a ton. We are a small family but the freezer will be a great fit when we order beef come fall! The seal is very strong and the shelving makes it easy to organize and find what you need.
, We had a small chest freezer and this freezer is huge in comparison and it holds so much food we cannot fill it even to 25% capacity. This would be a great freezer to hold a side of beef plus more. The external display tells how cold the internal temp ...
, We had to replace our 16 year old Frigidaire Upright after it died. I knew I wanted to stick with the same brand, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to get one as big. This one just had such a great price for what you get. I hope to get just as many years, ...
, Good product for what it is I would recommend it to someone that need to store frozen products in a small scale
, The only reason I gave this a 4 was that the door alarm takes too long to go off. I keep this in my garage, and by the time the alarm would go off, I would no longer be in there, I think most people who but a stand alone freezer would have it located o...
, My wife had complained for years about the freezer we had since it was not frost free. I finally gave in and the rest is history!
, Went looking to replace a 30 year old hand me down and we decided on this one. No issues it got to temp quickly and has been running great.
, Nothing bad to say, but I've only had it for a month. Nice size, good temp setting, cols down very quickly - from plug-in to -2 degrees took less than 2 hours
, I bought 3 of these freezers to store frozenen products for my business, and I plan to buy more. They just look really nice, and I like the temp. is very visible.
, Very nice unit. Lots of room. Great configuration. Can actually see what we have in the freezer. Had a Frigidaire prior and it lasted 17 years. Hoping this one will last as long.
, The price was great, the unit works great, it is small enough for a single family, yet large enough for a large family.
, Other than the compressor being loud, the freezer is great. Plenty of room, adjustable shelves, outside digital temp. reading, and no defrosting needed.
, Much better than our old chest freezer. Self defrost and quiet. Large and has good storage arrangement. Things are able to be stored better.
, Admittedly our old freezer was Ancient and needed to be replaced - this one is fabulous!  Keeps everything rock solid frozen and most importantly with kids - I love that I can get warehouse size boxes in it and that it will alarm if left open.
, If you are considering what size to get, go with the largest one you can afford.  We love the upright over the chest--makes it much easier to see what you have (and therefore make sure you use) than  a chest.
, We needed a basic freezer for our garage. It has great shelving options and is working well.
, Not a lot of bells and whistles -solid piece of workmanship
, great storage for upright freezer and shelfs. easy to find things.just a little noisy but overall great.
, This is the Second one I purchased this year for my wifes cookie business. Its a good size for the price.. But it runs a lot and its loud so if you're going to use it for your kitchen don't purchase this one.. Great for your basement or garage..
, From the excellent delivery and setup to the flawless performance this has been a great buying experience. Everything that our old one was missing, this one has. I would recommend this appliance to anyone looking for a good freezer.
, Awesome freezer as long as you have the room for it because it is huge. Works as advertised. We plugged it up after delivery and it was down to 0 degrees within a matter of minutes. Digital display is great and easy to operate. Seemed a little unstable...
, I love it it works awesome and we have loaded it with meat and it is great. I love the light
, Was very pleased with the purchase of this freezer and the features it offered. Was happy to get free delivery and set-up.
, has been working great so far. happy to have a freeze to fill. others have complained about the noise. i don't think it is that bad, but yes it does make noise. don't have other to compare it too tho.
, The unit is in the garage and I can hear it in the bedroom. I would not purchase this freezer if I had known.
, This is a great freezer.  Lots of space, adjustable door shelves.  I especially like the display on the door, showing the freezer temp, and the alarms for open door and high temp.
, This model has most all the great features. It is simply beautiful! It performs perfectly at factory settings. No need to adjust a thing. As with all appliances, the freezer must be placed on a solid surface and perfectly level, except the front, which...
, The website was easy to use. The refrigerator was in stock and shipped before schedule. It arrived on time and in good condition. Would order from them again.
, quiet and very efficient, lots of space. currently being stored in our garage. does not give out any heat.
, Compressor went out in !.5 Years. Never had a compressor go out so soon. Great freezer up to that point. :(
, We're very happy with the freezer. We replaced an upright and a chest freezer with this. It's roomy. The only problem is it's a bit noisy but it's in the garage so it's not a problem at all. Very Satisfied with it.
, This is the loudest freezer I've ever owned. If it was not out in the garage I would have returned it.
, Great freezer at a good price. I butcher a cow once a year and am always worried about the freezer not working. With the digital alarm and control panel I dont worry at all. When I walk by it I glance at the panel it reads. -10 degrees and no alarms an...
, Easy setup, good price for this size, included free delivery
, We have used this freezer for about 3.5 years now. We have never had any issues with this freezer working the way it should. We love the large storage space, the pull out baskets, the audio alarm that sounds when the door doesn't shut tightly (great wh...
, I needed a frezzer to store more food,and this one is big enough to store more than I thought it would.Talk about a sale,I`m glad I took advantage of this one.What a great buy.
, We ordered this freezer on-line and it has more volume than we expected, pleasantly so. This freezer has shelves, baskets and door rack bins for storing many different types and sizes of items. I like seeing the temperature display on the outside, one ...
, A great medium size freezer. The digital panel on the front is very convenient. Keeps a fairly constant temperature. Nicely organized in the interior. A good buy. No problems with the delivery or the removal of the old freezer.
, Great capacity, quiet, very roomy. Easy to load!!!!
, This could be the best freezer for the money if they would reduce the noise level when its running by 85%, it makes more noise then my 35 year old forced air furnace in the basement. I wish I had read some reviews on it before I bought it.
, Easy setup- quiet and very energy efficient- freezes stuff quickly- lots of extra room on the door- can move bins around to meet my needs
, I love this freezer. The adjustable shelves in the door make it more useful and it has lots of space. It holds the temp perfectly and the pull out baskets are great.
, I have only had my freezer for a few weeks, but so far I like it. My kids are forever leaving the door ajar, so the the alarm function is great. I also like that you can set the temperature.
, I love this freezer! Upright so you can see everything at a glance!! Love the shelves and baskets and the shelves in the doors are wonderful!!!
, We had to replace a different brand freezer/fridge combo for our garage several months ago and decided to buy two separate units (the fridge is: Frigidaire 16.7 Cu. Ft. Refrigerator - White). First, I called Frigidaire and made sure this unit was okay ...
, The freezer would not cool when we plugged it in. Temp. was 48 deg. after being turned on for 24 hours. Waited a month to get it because they had to order it. Now they have to order another one. Otherwise I don't know of anything else wrong with it.
, Great size freezer for the price. Very happy with over all unit. The compressor is a bit loud... it is like a dull hum in the background. I have it in the basement and if the kids are gone or sleeping I can hear the hum in the basement. Fridgator addre...
, Dependable and looks great. I can find anything I need..I do not have to dig

, This is a great refrigerator that gives you everything you need to keep food fresh longer, digital/touch controls great, nice style and tons of room inside for storage.
, This is a well designed spacious appliance. Brilliant, fashionable, shiny, well laid out. Thoughtfully designed. Easy to use, easy freezer opening.
, I love our new fridge. the look and most important the energy savings, I have young kids and the door alarm feature is a great bonus for when the kids don't shut the door all the way. Led lights is a very nice touch. Fridge seems to make plenty of ice ...
, I really like the Samsung French doors refrigerator with the Flex Zone drawer for snacks and drinks. It is so much easier to find things in the refrigerator. I am having problems with the freezer drawer not opening all the way and have only had the ref...
, The frig has big ice, big freezer, fits where we need it to. Beverage bin is cool too.
, Love this fridge! Its design is really nice and I love all of the space and flexibility. The only thing is the front of the fridge is a challenge to keep free of smudges.
, We use the ample freezer to store freshly-made stocks, garden vegetables, and bulk purchases of meats. The 4th drawer is excellent for keeping foods being prepared for the day's meals properly chilled until they're to be cooked. Excellent shelf space h...
, Samsung makes a superior product and this refrigerator is no exception! It is HUGE! and has tons of storage. The glass shelves are sleek and there are 2 shelves that are adjustable for taller items. I like that I don't have to open both doors to...
, The Samsung bottom freezer and french door refrigerator exceeded our expectations. Smallest french door/bottom freezer however, with lots of room. We had to remove the doors to fit the kitchen door. Removal and re-installation were very easy. Samsung...
, I really could go on and on about this product. Who knew I would be this excited over a refridgerator purchase. I wanted the bigger version of this refrigerator but the space in my kitchen wouldnt allow for it so I went with the smaller model. Let me...
, Great frig epecially for the size as I had somewhat of a tight spot to fit but the 25.5 was perfect. Waited for the sale and saved. Love the looks as we get many compliments and improved effieciency replacing a dated refrigerator. This is my second...
, I love this refrigerator, Im pretty sure it sings to me when I open up the french doors. Its so pretty!! As with all stainless appliances it is a bit of a pain to keep it perfectly shiny with no fingerprints but if you find the right product even thats...
, I had been researching refrigerators for some time before I made my decision. It seems that refrigerators are not made like they used to. No matter which brand you decided to go with, they are meant to break down over time instead of lasting. So with...
, A month in and everything is working as it should. I spent my whole life in manufacturing, and I can say the fit and finish of this refrigerator is world class. The lighting is great, the unit is quiet and the exterior does not show fingerprints. The...
, Great amount of room and the adjustable shelf is great for tall items. I love the pull out refrigerator drawer and the alarm for the doors not shut properly is great when you have kids. The only draw back I have found is that the motor is noisy.
, Had the refridgerator for one month now. It is very quiet. Wish beige was still in style. Only black, white, and stainless colors available. If you dont mind polishing it everyday, the stainless is very attractive. Weiman Stainless Steel polish works...
, I like our new ref. Just need to make sure you have cleaner for stainless steel.
, Ok, I know that these reviews help people so here we go. About a year and half ago I bought a older home and the first priority was re-doing the kitchen. I was finally left with replacing the frig and I cannnot explain to you in words how frustrating...
, I love everything about my fridge except the icemaker is too small. The drawer is perfect for the children! Saves on energy too. Very smartly made except the ice machine. Good thing we have a secondary fridge for additional ice.
, I always read these reviews and find them useful, so thought I better come back and leave one. Our initial problem was that while we had a 36 wide space for a fridge, the right side of the fridge is against a wall. If you haven't looked at the newer...
, While this fridge fits into the space I have, I would not recommend it! The shelves do not accommodate large bottles of soda or gallon jugs of milk (I do not store the milk in the door) the door shelves do not accommodate bottles of salad dressings or...
, My whole family loves this fridge. I was not sure how would like the bottom freezer, but it has a large drawer on top and it holds a ton. I love the ice and water dispenser on the outside And the xtra drawer in the middle is really awesome. I guess the...
, This refrigerator is beautiful. I love the extra drawer outside...keeps hubby away from holding the door open looking for his snacks. I put all his food in the drawer. Roomy, easy to open and close. Can't say enough. Highly recommend this refrigerator
, We had a side by side refrigerator which just did not have enough room to conveniently hold things in the freezer. One of our problems was the restriction on space for a new frig. Samsung was recommended to us by my sister who was also in the market...
, Our kitchen is small so I needed a small space fridge but I still wanted reasonable cubic feet. This product meets all of those criteria. It fit perfectly into the small space in my kitchen yet had tons of room inside. The interior is well lit, I can...
, I did not measure my door until the day the driver showed up to deliver the unit, needless to say, the unit did not fit. This was on January 13 in New York. Talking about cold weather, that night it was 17 degrees. Told the driver to make us his last...
, I have to say, we love this refrigerator! Unbelievable amount of inside space for a 33 wide fridge. The interior design is very convenient with adjustable, removable, and flip-up shelving and the in-door space is wonderful too. We never thought we...
, Couldn't believe it took 4 trips to my home to finally get one that didn't have any defects. Love Lowes though....stuck with us and made sure there were no defects in the final one we got. We do love this model so really didn't want to get another...
, I've been wanting this refrigerator for over a year now. Recently, Lowe's had a huge sale and my husband said let's go get one. It's perfect for us. I love the small shelves on the one door that everyone complains about. They are perfect for little...
, this appliance is big on the outside, but, difficult to work with on the inside. After almost a month, I still haven';t gotten shelves adjusted for easy usage. One door only has 2 full sized shelves, the other only one with 2 teeny useless ones. One...
, I really wanted a counter-depth refrigerator, but I didn't want a smaller fridge than my old 22 cu ft unit which would have been necessary given the small 34 opening in my cabinets. Fortunately, Samsung makes this huge capacity fridge that fits in...
, lol, I for one just love this appliance! I bought this and a Samsung gas stove at the same time, upon arrival it was about 15 above zero, brrrrrr. the stove came in with no prob. but even with the doors off the fridge. the doors had to come off coming...
, I originally was looking at the 28 cf flex drawer Samsung but it was too big for my kitchen. Was thrilled when Samsung came out with this smaller version. This refrigerator is perfect for the smaller kitchen. Beautiful, energy efficient, the flex...
, I have not found one thing I dislike about this refrigerator. I held a large x-mas party in 2011, and handle the party of 20 with only this refrigerator the Ice maker just keep putting out like a champ!! The delivery from ABT was the best I have...
, We actually had to wait a few weeks to get this refrigerator but it was worth it! Lots of storage in this deep fridge with flexible space to fit a gourmet cooks needs! Only thing I'm not a big fan of is the shiny surface on the black model. Shows lots...
, The only thing is that you have to do more in coordinating the delivery and finding and scheduling serve to connect the water, etc, but it all worked out fine.
, This is the second Samsung purchase that's broken down within a few months of ownership. Our 60 inch tv now this fridge!!!! I'm done with Samsung!!!! It's been a week now since it broke down and is under warranty and still no service man has come to...
, Love the new fridge! Keeps everything at a constant temp, love the middle drawer. We use that one primarily for canned drinks on one side, fresh meats on the other. Looks great, and of course there's the french door for the freezer, with two levels,...
, We have had this fridge for a few months and we really like it. It is well designed, and fits much more than our side by side. The pull out fridge drawer is great for bread, pop, or big pizza boxes. The ice maker makes enough ice. The finish does show ...
, keep in mind i was ready to pay full price ($3100 but got 40% for a sale- in november) i only have a 36 in opening at the end of the kitchen counter so most 36 in fridge wont open because of the wall, so a 33 in fridge with the split door allowed me to...
, It's a great product, we using it lat 2 month and everything is great
, Samsung label is cheap looking. The cover over the refrigerator controls is glued on and fell off. When you pay over$2300.00 for a refrigerator this is very unsatisfactory.
, We love our new refrigerator. The only complaints we have is that the water dispenser drips after you are done filling a glass, and that there is not enough room for tall items such as 2 liter bottles etc. I love having the second drawer, but wish the ...
, This fridge has been fantastic. The middle drawer is perfect for beverages and meats (I grill a lot and it keeps the meat fresher longer). It replaced a GE which had a component fail, leaked all over my hardwoods and ruined them, causing me significant...
, We did the research on the Internet and this fridge was the best one for our purposes.  We are waiting for the noise to develop as other's have said, but the only noise that comes is when the ice is made and it drops into the plastic bin. Water and ice...
, I purchased this refrigerator on Black Friday so the value was excellent. I love this refrigerator. There has not been a mechanical issue but of course I have not had it that long. The features of fold up shelves, sliding shelves and the deli drawer ar...
, I'm not sure why some folks are saying the icemaker doesn't make enough ice. My wife and three kids use it all the time and have never run out. Maybe they got defective icemakers? Not sure, but we love our new fridge. Love the middle drawer for keeping...
, We needed a fridge for a specific smaller space and we wanted the bottom freezer/4 door and this one fits. Love the split door. Now all the daily use food is at eye level. Its quiet and water dispenser on door accommodates a larger water bottle. The mi...
, I was skeptical about buying a french door fridge, but now I'm really enjoying it. I like the design and layout of shelves, door storage, and deli drawer!
, We really like our new fridge; it is stylish, has plenty of variable space, and is overall high quality. However, when it's quiet and you want to enjoy TV or music often, especially after it has been opened a few times to take something out, there will...
, This is a very nice refrigerator. Plenty of room for storage of kid food items with the center drawer. Nice design really adds to the kitchen. Only two drawbacks is the ice maker is very noisy when making ice at times and second was subcontractors who ...
, Love this fridge for sure! Big, cold and well lit with those LED lights. I have two boys and its more than big enough to hold everything we need. Gallon milk in the door frees us alot of shelf space, and the shelves slide in and out to give you more sp...
, Overall, we like this refrigerator--we have had it for almost 2 months. The good--love the features and it looks great. The temperature control is perfect (I have checked it!). Ice and water through the door works great. Overall, very smartly designed....
, The ice maker is located in the refrigerator compartment. You lose the entire top left shelf as well as a lot of inside the door storage space.
, We really liked the design of the larger model but felt the dimensions of the smaller fridge worked better in our kitchen. I was concerned we would lose features(no one seemed to be able to answer our question regarding this) but unlike a previous revi...
, WORKS GREAT! QUIET, ENERGY EFFICIENT, AND VERY ATTRACTIVE LOOKING. READING THE BRIEF PAGES IN THE OWNERS MANUAL REALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND A FEW THINGS I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN OTHERWISE. ALSO, I WAS ABLE TO UPGRADE THE WATER LINE FROM THE UNDER SINK WA...
, This fridge is cool. The drawers make access a breeze. The technology and controls operate slick and the the overall look is impressive. The middle drawer for handy snacks for kids and special temperature controls for it are super-convenient. Only flaw...
, We received this refrig. last week, and very shortly became disappointed. Both the larger model ( #RF4287HARS 28cu ft.) and this one (#RF4267HARS 25 cu. ft.) had the same retail price of $2999.95, but both were on sale for the same price. However, Sams...
, I love, love, love this fridge and all the neat features. Lots and lots of room in the fridge and freezer. The extra drawer is so handy. There is nothing that I don't like about this product.
, We looked at every fridge out there. Didn't take long and we knew that the Samsung was our choice. We do have a leak that we are trying to figure out where it is coming from (we think the pump). Called for service and there is no one in our area that c...
, I am very happy with the style of the refrigerator. I have plenty of room for everything the way it is layed out. Very convenient for my grandchildren. Love the middle drawer. The ice maker is quick. Never run out of ice. I knew Samsung was a great pro...
, Love all the features and I have not found anything to be negative about it yet.
, The ice maker is supposed to creat ice for a big family. So not the case. It is just just my husband and I using ice and we deplete it in an hour. How much ice could we be using? Our 15 year old ice maker made ice all the time. We never had to but ice ...
, Traded up from an older freezer bottom model. A lot more space in this one although the configuration on doors takes some getting used to. Make sure you measure your door opening and have a delivery guy that knows what they are doing. The dimensions ar...
, We are very happy with our Samsung refrigerator. Love all the features and the space.
, I've had this model for a year and a half and still wishing I could have my old GE26cuft refrigerator. I find it a lot more difficult to arrange and accomodate foods inside compared to my previous side by side model. Bottom freezer is a joke, I'm const...
, We rushed out one evening and bought this refrigerator because our old one was dying. We got quick delivery, and it cooled down fast. The french doors on top and pull-out freezer provide great access. The middle drawer, which we use for lunch meat, che...
, Great product. Manual could use some spiffing up. Color, better instructions. In particular, what are the best temperature settings and better explanations on how to adjust them. Shelves difficult to adjust.
, The touch panel plate had fallen off after two months of light use. Called Samsung's customer service and was told that they don't carry the plate itself. Samsung offered to send out a technician to determine if it was a MECHANICAL FAILURE and if it wa...
, Love all the drawers. So much room. Crush ice choice is wonderful. Keeps frozen items very very frozen. Ice cream is super hard when taken out. Love the stainless look also.
, Got this as an Open Box Item, so the price was really right. The second drawer allows for variable temperature settings based on how you want to use it -- very handy. Fingerprints could be a problem with children, but hardy a reason not to buy it. Plen...
, We are a family of 4 and are at this moment we are moving our groceries from our old refrigerator to this one. The old refrigerator is a side by side which needed to be replaced. Long story short... the food from the old refrigerator dose not fit in th...
, I bought this refrigerator in October, 2010. In August , 2012 I had to replace the digital panel on the front door. Now it is March, 2013 and the panel has gone out again. JUNK!!! I will never purchase a Samsung refrigerator again.

I am very please and it has changed the look of my kitchen.
, The pre-sets are really cool.  Love how it tells you to turn the food over at certain points during defrost.  the fan is efficient.  Very nice design. Perfect compliment to our new kitchen.
, I really like this unit...Great price and pretty easy to install. Many thanks!
, heats quicker than older model, appearance is nice
, This is a great appliance. The controls are very simple to use. It looks good over the range, and adds a lot to the looks of the kitchen. I have come to expect excellence in Samsung products and that's what they provide. I have never been disappointed ...
, Love the design and features. And the price was right on time.
, I have been buying Samsung product for years and the quality and dependability has exceeded most other products.
, Has been a great microwave so far very easy to use and looks great have own it for 2months know.
, Bought this new and had it installed professionally. Everything went great until, about 18 months into its life, the microwave started emitting random beeps from time to time. There was no error message at first and everything else was functioning prop...
, This microwave looks great and cooks very evenly. It has lots of features.
, My Samsung microwave oven broke four months after the extended warranty expired. Repair will cost more than the oven itself.
, I was looking for a microwave to match my Samusng range and i found this was a great choice.
, Item is working great. Love it. Will tell all of my family and friends.
, The light inside could be brighter or make it easier to see inside the window.  Heats things up great!
, I'm sorry, but a microwave should last more than two years. Mine lasted just enough that the warranty expired, but not long enough to make it worth the price. The features were average, ease of use average, but the stainless easily dented and scratched...
, happy with it. works well and looks good. thank you very much.
, the styling is great the product was easy to install I like the rack in the unit, it is easy to use, the preset buttons are a great feature
, Looks great in kitchen with matching appliances. Love the turntable option on & off feature. Air filter is also a great option.
, we got this item as an open box so we really had a good deal, it works fine and powerful cooks food fast. although after a few weeks it got a bit noisy and a few days back the grill sparked and knicked the inside :(. it still works though.
, This is the first microwave I ever bought. The other one I had worked for years and was given to me by my grandparents. This one looks great and is much more efficient!
, good features all around. small concern about the metal rack
, Sure it is not very expensive and it looks good, but mine broke down after about 18 months, conveniently after the warranty had expired. So I had to go through the hassle of installing a new one. It seems to be a problem with the circuit board or the k...
, The microwave came with very detailed instructions to install.
, I suppose after i memerize the keyboard, I might get used to it, but the buttons are so hard to read! My last microwave hat quick buttons where you only had to hit the 1 to 7 buttons to heat for those times and didn't need to hit anything else. This on...
, the micro seems to work fine but it makes more noise than i would like. also, what the heck is that metal rack in the middle of the microwave for?
, I'm enjoying the large interior. The self instructions are so easy to understand. It cooks so fast and evenly.
, excellent, efficient and great looking. Is doing everything I had expected
, Microwave only lasted 3 weeks and Bes vBuy t is no longer my favorite electronics store. This didnt help either!
, Great buy for the price. Instructions were easy to follow during installation and it is beautiful looking once installed.
, Just your average microwave OK for the price. Picked this one to match other Samsung appliances.
, It is solid and performs reliably (thus far). Its buttons are not easy to push nor read. It is hard to use in low light. I wish it had a one-touch, one-minute cook button like our old Frigidair. I like its cool blue lights and it runs very quietly.
, My 2 year can now operate this microwave ..it is very easy to use and like all the preset selections
, Bought for a second house. Would buy again Thank you.
, Love this thing as it cooks real good and even. Never had so much microwave popcorn actually pop before.
, This is a great microwave! Looks good and works great. It is easy to use and has all the features you'll ever need. My only issue was with installation since it was my first one to install. Overall a great purchase.
, It is what it is. It heats up stuff. Not much more you can really ask for. Not sure about the key pad stuff peps are talking about.
, This microwave broke after 15 months of use, just after 3 months of expiration of the warranty. This lifetime of the product seems to be calculated my the manufacturer. I will never again buy a Sumsung microwave. The problem seems to be with cables at ...
, We really like this microwave. It is a good value for the money. We looked at several and decided this was the best option. It looks great and works well. It seems to be powerful and heats up items faster than our previous microwave.
, I like it but wish that it included quick cook buttons.
, I love it. Samsung has an awesome product. I enjoy it's the capabilities in the way it sits on top of the stove I also like the way it sounds it doesn't give you a lot of noise and the reception of it is very of adequate
, Great deal for this microwave. Works great. Easy to install.
, This microwave has great features and the price is excellent.
, It's doing everything I need it to do but until it's 10 years old without breaking I won't be happy.
, My old microwave used to take twice as long to heat up food. This microwave works great and popcorn button makes just perfect popcorn. Heating up two different plates on different selves is nice, but I find it takes longer to heat up food that way. I a...
, Great for every day use, great price. Works well for what I need.
, Microwave was part of a package deal. Only had it for 1 wk. So far, we are happy with the purchase.

, excellent. I had it install with the smoke leading outside and works great.
, Nice microwave that is easy to operate looks great
, Good clean design, easy controls, good performance
, I really wanted the LED cooktop lighting to complete the look of my new Samsung kitchen appliances but I could not justify the extra $100 to get that. I'll look into a dimable LED bulb to replace the cooktop light. This microwave works great. Excellent...
, This was an excellent investment since I have never owned an over the range microwave. However, I find it a little bit of a hassle for my reaching it. . . since I am a short person. Otherwise, my husband and I are really enjoying ourselves in using thi...
, It is a bit noisier than my last but not bad enough to outweigh the great things. Even heating. Easy to use.
, it cooks good the food but company didnt stall me the electric power.
, Gorgeous microwave and easy to use. The vent fan is very strong. Had the fan venting outside the house.
, So far this microwave have been amazing. Very easy to clean and tons of space inside.
, This is a great microwave. Very stylish and very easy to use.
, The controls and preset programs are easy to understand. Does everything you would expect from a microwave.
, To me, a microwave is a microwave is a microwave. This is just a microwave that matches my other appliances. It's got everything you would expect to get from a microwave. It works, it cooks food, has a clock.... I guess I am the wrong one to review it,...
, Overall, this is a great over-the-counter microwave. It works very well and was relatively easy to install as replacement for an older one.
, After 16 months the board that controls the touch interface died. The repair estimate was twice what I paid for the microwave! Like another reviewer said, if you're absolutely set on this piece of junk, then buy the extended warranty.
, microwave is efficient and powerful love the easy to use controls. It is big enough to handle large items and has an acceptable nosie level.
, I have always had Samsung microwaves. You can't go wrong with them. This has many features and works great.
, My Samsung stainless microwave is an excellent accompanyment to my Samsung stainless stove. together they work really well and look just as great. The microwave is really easy to use, the turntable works well and the heated food perfect. I use the micr...
, I am enjoying my new over the range microwave. It's so nice to have additional counter space now that I have this one! Works nicely and looks nice too!
, Love how the layout of the buttons work. Someone was listen to the customer. I would recommend this to friends.
, All around good microwave. Nice preformance i.e. cooks fast... I like the popcorn autocook. This thing knows when to stop cooking, love it!
, This is a nice microwave with a nice size interior. The only down side is it does not have the one touch express minute options we were told it did.
, Bought this with complete kitchen appliance makeover. Limited use so far, but seems to work very well. Love the Samsung brand!
, Great microwave with plenty of space for large dishes. Looks great and is easy to use.
, Great product, modern feel, and great performance. Works like a charm, has great 4 speed fan.
, It looks very nice and was easy to install. I was able to install it by myself. It works as expected.
, I like this microwave since it looks like a flat screen TV which adds to the decor of my kitchen. It has a shelve, so I can warm up multiple dishes.
, Bought this microwave with the rest of our kitchen set and am quite pleased. It looks nice in out kitchen and we were able to mount it above the stove to create more space on the new countertops. Very happy with this purchase - was able to get a great ...
, Love the look and its convenient. Easy for kids to use. All colors it comes in are beautiful. And for the price, you can't go wrong.
, My guess is that this is a good machine however it is impossible to know the potential with such poorly presented instructions and guides.
, This microwave is good looking,cooks quickly and fairly quietly.It was easy to install.I particularly like the four speed exhaust fan.
, I've only had the microwave a couple of weeks, but so far I have no complaints. The blower on the microwave turns up to an impressive setting (it's loud, but no louder than other microwaves I've encountered). It also reheats things evenly, so there are...
, Easy to use, powerful, cooks evenly.
, Would not buy this product. It has quit working after 19 month purchase. SE error and nothing on the microwave panel will turn on. A waste of time and money on this purchase.
, This mw oven has failed twice in 20 months. The first time was 6 months after buying it, repair was covered under warranty. Second time was the internet notorious -SE- Error. You get really good at unplugging and plugging it back in. This time, my...
, Purchased this with the stove, refrigerator and dishwasher! Had this just over 1 year and the door lach broke and won't shut, therefore, won't work! Diswasher doesn't clean dishes well, stove top doesn't clean up either. We like the refrig even...
, Bought this microwave in Sept 2011! It Went out on Feb 20, 2012.It made a funny sound and then quit.
, The microwave stopped working after a year. The panel shows SE and nothing will work on the microwave .
, Good OTR microwave, haven't had for to long so hoping doesn't die after a year but sos far so good. Had a GE OTR that died after two weeks, Lowe's return policy is good. Pros: Better than GE, Good CFM Cons: No one minute cycle, although added it as...
, Microwave was a replacement during a remodel. Microwave works great, but buy replacement cooktop ligthts when you get it, because the ones that come with it are VERY cheap and burn out within a month.
, This customer did not provide a text review.
, This is a good value for the money. The issues are it is difficult to read some of the small print. It is bigger than our old microwave and we love that feature. It is easy to use as well.
, I purchased and installed this microwave to find the door did not shut correctly. Standing back from the micro you could easily see the door did not line up when it closed, it was off 1/8th inch. Good thing Lowe's has a great return policy.
, Have purchased 2 of them. First one in March of 2010. On New Years Day, Jan 1st, 2011 less than a yr old it just died. We exchanged it for the exact same model that same day. Today July 10, 2011 just over 7 months the second one died. Not buying this...
, Microwave control Panel stopped working during warranty period. After warranty period, new control panel stopped working. Samsung said, too bad; your out of warranty. Repair cost = $200. I bought a new Whirlpool microwave for $289 including...
, It claims to have more ventilation power but I did not see any noticeable results. The keyboard features had much to be desired (once programmed it can't be modified and there are no preset times except for 30 sec). The hood light needs to be brighter...
, Visually the microwave looks great, it is also easy to use, however, it stopped working in less than 2 years since purchase. The problem started with over the range lights switching on and off on their own, the fan switching on and off on its own. Now...
, This piece of junk went bad after only two years! Keypad I think. SE error. Nobody in Naples would service Samsung junk either.
, Lowe's offers great service but a poor product in Sumsung. Microwave handle broke for the 2nd time, Dec. 10, 2011, in less than 3yrs. Number pad had to be replace within the 1st yr. Replaced the frig within 3 wks. Dish washer has had the service 5...
, Only had this microwave 6 months when it quit.Called Samsung and they sent a repairman out.He tells us it had blown a fuse.Fuse replaced(after waiting 2 weeks for part to come in) and not even a week later it does the same thing.I researched the...
, Purchased this microwave even after reading the less than glowing reviews. I liked the design and wanted a microwave that functioned well as a range hood. The Lowes installation took 20 minutes. The first thing I did was put the fan (400cfm) to work by...
, Had to return first one due to defect discovered at last step of install. One of the 2 nuts on the top of the unit let go and fell into oven insides during installation when I was trying to get screw bolt started into it. After exchanging the unit for...
, Purchased on a Saturday, installed on Sunday, dead by Friday. Acts like its working, but no cooking action.
, We bought this microwave 2 years ago. The door squeaks when we open it. The light inside blinks a lot and it makes an annoying clicking sound when it stops. Not happy with the product, seems like it is dying already. I wish it worked right because it...
, Great microwave. Very powerful and good looking. Perfectly matches the Samsung refrigerator which is located on the same wall. Seems like a small thing, but has very pleasant sounds - the old microwave sounds were sooo annoying and loud.
, I chose this model based on CR recs and its great price.  Install was straightforward.  It looks great with my stainless range, fridge, and DW.    I was upgrading from a small countertop model and am astounded at the capacity and power of this thing.  ...
, Installation was wonderful.  Worried about the larger size of unit compared to original microwave in place.  Installers did a great job of making necessary adjustments!!
, The couple of things I don't like about it. - The color and size of the display make it difficult to read. - The stainless part of it is hard to keep clean. - It is missing a few reheat options I was used to on my last microwave. Functionality wise tho...
, This product is great! Goes well with all other Samsung appliances. Do read the instructions before installing. I have to recirculate the vented air, so I had to change the direction of the fan BEFORE you install it. Had I not read the directions my in...
, For the value, I didn't feel it was necessary to choose the upgraded version of this microwave. I feel that it has many features that I wouldn't have considered but find that I appreciate very much. I would definitely recommend it to another person.
, this microwave has been great. i was not sure about getting a new microwave but with our remodel, we had too. this samsung has met our needs and i really enjoy a dependable microwave. love it! would purchase another when the time comes.
, Great microwave for the value. Easy to install. Great look and features.
, Satisfied with the performance and looks. Powerful microwave.
, This microwave looked good, but it was very noisy when the magnatron came on. The whole microwave vibrated and was very noisy. Had the magnatron and transformer replaced. Had the same problem. When cooking on the stove, it did not vent the steam well. ...
, This microwave looks nice and matches my stove and other Samsung appliaces. The over-range light seems dim, even on the high setting. The microwave is LOUD every time it starts. The noise goes away after 4-5 seconds, but it is annoying. The exhaust fan...
, great microwave, easy to use for older adults and looks good
, An excellent microwave. After 2 months, it works exactly as advertised and looks great. The sensor cooking and defrost are always spot on!
, I just remodeled my entire kitchen - cherry cabinets, granite counter tops and new higher end appliances. I could not find the model I had wanted and ended up picking this product - its looks fantastic and is incredibly easy to use with more functions ...
, This is a powerfull microwave. The sensor cooking and defrost are always spot on, and I love the way that the bottoms save me time.
, I didn't install or use this microwave as my wife decided she wanted a feature set from a different brand and model, so it was returned. Four star rating was for appearance.
, I am happy with the large size and functions available on this microwave.
, I compared this model to every other microwave in the store with similar features. I love the Samsung brand. It has a beautiful finish and a larger capacity than every one in it's price range. The price made it a no brainer!
, This was a replacement for an older model from same manufacturer the control panel is updated some so I had to learn it. (Read the instructions for a change). Works fine.
, It cooks food just like any other $200 microwave. However, it has problems and is probably a short-timer. 1. Even fresh out-of-the-box, the door sags due to sloppy hinges and does not line up with top of microwave. 2. Very very very loud when in use. I...
, So sad - thought Samsung was a quality product... not at all.
, I really like the microwave, a little disappointed that the lettering on the front came off. My husband fixed it, but now i see a scratch where he sanded off the glue. i'm sure no one else notices but I know its there
, So far this has worked great. The variable speed fan is more than powerful enough to clean the air over the cooktop. One item that limits this from getting an excellent rating is the light. It is not very bright.
, Just replace old E-Wave with this product. Very solid so far. Cooks like crazy. Took me about 15 minutes to fully install. If Samsung builds thier microwaves like thier other products should be around for a long time.
, Microwaves have become so cheap; it's easier to replace rather than fix. I am disappointed that the door has a cheap feel/not very tight seal when closed. Otherwise, I like the features. I would consider this microwave to have average power - not great.
, At first glance I was disappointed with some of the button choices. On my last unit, popcorn had multiple choices depending on bag size, but worked best at 2.22--this one doesn't display any time until after the cooking is partially finished, but alway...
, Researched this microwave on Consumer Reports and did a search to find the lowest price which was Best Buy. Great value for the money.
, We purchased the microwave on 12/17/11. On 12/24/11 we noticed that the door was hard to open. Once we pulled the door open we found that the plastic from a three inch section on the door had melted. We removed it and exchanged it that day for a new on...
, I have to admit, when I pulled this out of the box, I was pretty skeptical. This microwave weighs much less (about half!) than the 10-year old microwave that I was replacing. Any amount of doubt was quickly laid to rest when I fired it up. It is powerf...
, its a good price initially it was quiet but now the turntable makes noise and a week after i got it the plastic on the numbers started peeling off.....i wouldnt buy another samsung...and i own a samsung tv fridge but
, 1) DID NOT OPERATE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. MADE LOUD, DYSFUNCTIONAL NOISES THEN STOPPED OPERATING, & REQUIRED CLOCK RESET-OVER & OVER & OVER & NEVER WORKED-AFTER THE INSTALLER LEFT. NOT THE SIGN OF A QUALITY PRODUCT. RETURN SCHEDULED. 2) 16 DEEP AND DID...
, Coupled with the matching 5 burner convection oven - kitchen looks like it had a makeover!
, I had looked at alot of microwaves and this one caught my eye. My husband installed it, not too difficult to install. The look of the microwave is very appealing and the controls are easy to use. The food is heated through very evenly and it heats up p...
, Great looking microwave. Matched our other appliances. Worked great - for one year. Bought it on April 1 2011 - just died on April 8 2012. Just spent an hour and 1/2 trying to get someone who freaking cares on the phone with NO success. UGH! If you buy...
, This unit is quiet, inexpensive, functional, and it looks good. Additionally, it's not too hard to install for anyone with a moderate level of handyman experience. One problem we saw on the machine when we opened the box was a dent on one of the back c...
, Excellent product. Elegant design, powerful, many options.
, Great quality. I really love the look and the features.
, We purchased the microwave just before Christmas 2011. It was relatively easy to install ( basic carpentry skills - using a drill, finding a stud;had an over the range microwave already; otherwise, an electrician would have been needed to put in a dedi...
, I purchased all the my appliances Samsung last year.. including this microwave and it just broke after its first year warranty. not to mention the dishwasher broke as well and needed to be replaced. Don't buy Samsung appliances!!
, Very good microwave oven. It has the evenest cooking of any microwave we have owned in the past. We like most everything, except find the control panel a bit hard to read (over 70). Some of the controls are a bit confusing too. But,we keep the manual h...
, Overall this is a great-looking, easy to use micro/hood combo. I do miss a couple often-used one touch button my previous microwave had, but I'm getting used to it. Also the cook surface light could be brighter.
, This is a solid performer, but don't expect anything too fancy. I would buy it again if I was buying a microwave.
, So far, so good! Bought this to replace my Panasonic Inverter Microwave that died after just 5 years. This one took different brackets, but was overall pretty easy to install. I like to sleek look, adds light to the kitchen. It is quieter than other mi...
, I bought for a Gift but when I open (after two month) then I'm surprise that everything was bad. The box looks like was fall down couple times.
, I do a lot of the cooking at home and most of it with a microwave. With the many features and the cooking sensor it makes my cooking look great and done the first time.
, This is a great product and would recommend it to anyone. It cooks quick and even, is extremely quiet, and the defrost works perfect, not cooking your food while thawing. The exahust fan is powerful but not too loud as well. I installed it myself and i...
, This is a good product, however, it is not as user friendly as my previous microwave. After a few weeks, I still have to think about how to program for some features. The fan is strong / satisfactory, but seems to be quite loud on high. Considering...
, This microwave has good features for its price, but no microwave should break after only 2 yrs. Just went dead, no power, lights or anything. Given the number of other reviewers with similar problems, I would not recommend this microwave to anyone.
, The best looking on the market, sensor heat works great and over all vary nice . Installs easy nice templates for screw holes!
, I bought this item after having all whirlpool appliances and I switched all of my appliances to Samsung and everthing works great and looks great! I love how this microwave cooks and just looks clean. No matter how much I cleaned the whirlpool microwav...
, Exhaust fan is unacceptable. Samsung should be a ashamed of themselves for releasing a product like this.
, I have been pleased with the features and the look. I did quite a bit of research and found this one to be the best bang for your buck Samsung microwave
, I installed this product and noticed the door did not shut properly. It rubbed at the top and when finally closed the lines were off, ie the top of the micro door sloped downward so it was 1/8th inch lower than the top of the control panel. All other d...
, Works perfect!! and looks very good in my new kitchen.
, I mean, it heats up, good price, over the range... what else you want?!?!
, Really like the Microwave but it stopped working with a fault code 366 days after purchase and 1 day out of warranty. Samsung agreed to repair it under warranty and the engineer who came to the house said it had a loose wire behind the touch panel. Ano...
, This microwave was a great value. We've had no problems with it. It seems to heat evenly. We've had it now for a few months. We use it between 3-8 times per week. It would be nice if the light was a little brighter, but overall it's not bad.
, Very nice unit. works great. All the specialty operations work well.
, Installation would have been much easier, had I not had to adapt to an existing range hood installation. Exhaust outlet was in a slightly different place, but nothing that good old duct tape couldn't handle. The oven, itself performs very well. defrost...
, It is very nice, and by all means it is quiet, just can be a tiny bit more quiet and it would be perfect! Love the night light with the timer. Cooks evenly and good and gets all the microwave jobs done with great features, Matches the stove perfect too!
, This Samsung is a pretty good microwave. Nothing great. Nothing terrible. PROS 1. STAINLESS STEEL / LOOKS: We like the way this one looks and we're redoing our kitchen appliances and are going with the Samsung lines. 2. SENSOR RE-HEAT / POPCORN BUTTONS...
, dont be fooled by the grand looks of the product do your homework and save your money and purchase a more reliable product that will not stop working just after a year of purchase. samsung cleve advertising is targeting the new 40 something generation ...
, I replaced my old microwave with this one, only because the handle brook on my old one. I got this at a great sale price which I'm happy about. It was easy to install, looks grate, and matches my Samsung refrigerator perfectly. It seems to work fine al...
, So this microwave started having trouble only 10 months after we purchased it. Samsung came to repair it which was a horrible experience on its own, their customer service is horrible, and the first time they came they replaced the wrong part all toget...
, Overall, product works fine, the light could be brighter, and the glass cover mysteriously crack. Attempting to get it replaced. When installing the microwave we noticed it did not include a side bracket that would help keep the microwave more secure. ...
, We purchased this microwave after the original one that came with our new home died. We've had it for about a month now and it's worked very well. Easy to clean, heats evenly, plenty of interior space. The interface isn't too complicared to understand ...
, We have had this microwave for a few weeks now. It is a generally good microwave with a few notable points. The keypad configuration is not terribly intuitive but you get used to it within a week. The vent fan is amazing. It really pulls a significant ...
, I bought it for $300 June 2010. It just quit working and I got and error code of SE and it beeped alot. I called Samsung and they told me my one year warranty had expired, but if it was the magnatron, it has a 10 year warranty. They will call a repair ...
, poor lighting under bottom' only one bulb,doesn't help the top of the stove for cooking at all.
, We liked this microwave. It matched our new Samsung oven and had nice features. But after 15 months, I got the SE (system error) on the display, and no amount of power resets #Samsung's only solution# would fix it. Google this brand microwave, and yo...
, I replaced my frigidaire microwave with this one. It was an easy install into an existing over the range location. This microwave is noisier than my old one and the start button is not in the most intuitive location but it does work well. The fan is mu...
, We've had 2 GE microwaves and niether of them lasted longer than 3 yrs. That is why we went with the samsung. We're hoping this one does. And you can't beat the 10 yr. warrenty on the megatron! This really sold us. I also liked that it has the ECO button.
, Rating is only good due to last Samsung microwave (almost same model) only lasted 1 and 1/2 years before biting the dust. Hopefully this one lasts longer since I built it in over the range. This required taking out molding etc.
, Heat's up everything we need cooked/heated as expected.
, Purchased this microwave for my kitchen remodel to match the Samsung fridge I purchased. Looks very very good, it works great. So far so good. I would recommend this product to anyone. Thanks . the only issue if any is that the it fingerprints quickly ...
, Overall, we are really happy with our microwave. It was easy to install and looks great!
, Looks great in my kitchen with other Samsung appliances. Easy to clean, roomy interior, and cooks food fast. Lots of great options on the keypad. Cooks popcorn perfectly!
, Purchased Black Friday < $200. NIce and roomy and good power. Cooks fast and consistently. Seems to heat very evenly. Was very easy to install. Fits perfectly in a standard opening. There are sufficient options like reheat, popcorn and 30 second plus b...
, This microwave looks great, functionally it is a good microwave. The couple problems with it is the under counter light is dismal and the control panel is a little too complex. I've had this for about a month and i sill have trouble finding the start a...

, Failures in occurrence order: 1) Clock stopped 2) Handle came off 3) Turntable stopped 4) Unit stopped working all together
, We did a total kitchen remodel & picked this one for size & watts. While the light was dim & I thought wouldn't be good when cooking on the stove top, we got used to it. Our keypad stopped working at 24 months with the error message SE. We tried all ...
, It is just a microwave ... it fits with the look of my kitchen and it works. The 30 Second interval v. 1 minute is nice.
, Great Price but doesnt heat evenly. Power seems to be lacking as it takes longer to heat everything.
, We purchased all new stainless appliances and this microwave was perfect match to the rest we purchased. It is of great quality and looks very nice with the stove and fridge.
, Love Samsung products usually but the cheapness of the outer housing was a let down. And now has failed 4 times to pop popcorn by using the popcorn button. Kicks on and runs but doesn't do anything. If not for getting such a good price(bought on sale) ...
, My older unit died so we decided on this one. So far love it. It cooks faster ( more wattage ) than the old one.it sticks out over the stove and that's a good thing for the ex.fan. I do not like the blue display. The lines on the numbers are thiner and...
, So sad... I typically like Samsung products, I have a phone, laptop, washer & dryer, etc. all from Samsung and they have been good solid products, till now. Purchased this microwave on Nov. 4, 2011 and it died on us early January 2013. Now I never buy ...

, great looking piece looks great in the kitchen,great quality, price ,and easy operation
, I love, love, love my new Samsung Space-saver Microwave! The impact of replacing my counter-top microwave with this over-the-range microwave on my counter-space is humongous. This is my first space-saver so I'm sure my enthusiasm is probably different ...
, It was great while it was working. Circuit board failed after 2 years, had SE error code. Bought a new circuit board, lasted 6 weeks. Love my washer,dryer, refrigerator and stove. Not so much dishwasher, but microwave is definately the worst purchase. ...
, Would be better if the front button panel is iluminated, overall rating I would say Excellent !! It's defrosting feature is really accurate, 400cfm of air vent suction is fine,I paid $180 in special price!! Awsome deal for a MicroW like this!! Powerful...

, Last one lasted 16 years and is still working but not as it should . that is why i stuck with the same brand.
, The microwave element quit working in just a few days, might have just been a lemon. But I sure wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Home Depot refunded our money without a hassle.
, I have only had this microwave for about a month, but so far it has worked very well. The quick minute and sensor cooking are nice features, and it is easy to use. It is quite roomy inside, but does take up a lot of counter space.
, I replaced a 27 year old microwave with this and everything cooks in 1/3 less time. It draws a lot of power so you need a dedicated circuit for it though, or you might be making a lot of trips to the circuit breaker. It is a great deal on it also.
, Purchased this product on line and has more than met our expections. This was an appliance replacement of 26 years and it hasn't been a disappointment. Size is great, rotating plate which we didn't have previously is nice feature, and we especially...
, Fantastic delivery. Ordered one night and delivered next afternoon.
, This mailbox is everything I expected: roomy, well constructed, and a good price.
, Great price as a replacement to a previous Panasonic. Quick shipment; pleased with purchase.
, Economically priced and simplicity in operation makes this a great product.
, Features are plentiful and easy to use. Product arrived quickly from online order but made a loud noise on starting and stopping. Was able to get repaired locally and at no cost, and now it's fine.
, The product is easy to use. The directions are easy to understand. I especially like the 1250 watts because the time used to cook or warm is much less than with a weaker wattage. I chose the black color which goes with any type of kitchen decoration. I...
, This is my first full size model, my first microwave being a hand me down .6 cubic foot model. Wow - had I known how fabulous the sensor reheat and cook feature worked, I would have purchased one much sooner. The popcorn feature works perfectly - no...
, This microwave is a little smaller than some, but if you're looking to save counterspace it's the way to go. The sensor cook option is great - just set it and forget it. It also has over 1,000 watts of power which is a lot for a smaller microwave.
, This is a great Microwave.Easy to use and nice looking.Worth the price.Can't go wrong.
, Fast and prompt delivery in excellent condition. Worked right out of box.Thank you...
, Delivered fast, in great condition, no issues there. So far, I've found the sensor reheat works way better than guessing how much time to cook leftovers!
, This the second one I am buying. The first one lasted 2 years - repair estimate was $85 (kaput transformer(?)). We use the microwave extensively - about an hour a day. It is fast, powerful and large. For the price, this works for me. I hope this one...
, Thank you, for the free shipping. I like the size, and it is easy to operate. Great for my family. Thank you. Lana, Louisville KY
, It's hard to get excited over a microwave for me. But this is the third one I've had since I've been married and also the coolest. It's easy to use and still has features that I've yet to tap into.
, [...]. I ran it through the demo mode to make sure it worked. No problem. Then I tried to use it. Big problem !!! The noise that came out of that thing was akin to a jackhammer hitting solid steel. My ears were left ringing, my son ran for cover and my...

, I bought this microwave for the office, so it gets a great amount of use. It's easy to use and works very well.
, I read all the negative reviews which made me want to share my experience. I bought this model only in SS about 5 yrs ago in store. Every feature is still working perfectly. I have since read an article about the developement team which studied and put...
, love it and would recommend it to all! Heats quickly and will accommodate a large casserole dish. 2nd one we have owned...we use it till it dies and purchase another.
, I bought this oven based on power and capacity.  The power is there; but the capacity is flat.  I would have trouble heating a tall soup container in here because it would barely fit.  That said, it heats well and the sensor controls are convenient.  H...
, Met my expectations!
, Cheaper than anyone else and no flaws.  Took a while to arrive but worth the wait for the price.
, Very quiet. Simple to use.
, I selected this microwave because if the inverter technology. It makes a huge difference in the quality of food, which comes out evenly cooked or defrosted. I'm very pleased with the Sensor Cook and Sensor Reheat functions, also. Steamed broccoli perfe...

, My husband even had to agree that this refrigerator was a wise choice. It makes it much handier to get at the food and not have food get lost in the back of the refrigerator. We like the drawers in the pull out freezer section. Easier to see things.

, A great product that fit the space in the kitchen that was custom designed in 1968 that didn't require moving a plastered wall and rebuilding a new pantry.

, the chest freezer has plenty of room with an additional two racks that come with it. Excellent reviews on the product which eases my worries. I would reccomend this product to other buyers.
, was debating about the cheaper versions. bad reviews steered me away. got this instead. no complaints. plenty of space for a family of 4.
, This product is affordable and comes in handy for that extra freezer space without taking up a lot of room!
, We needed a small chest freezer to supplement the less-than-expansive fridge freezer. This chest freezer provided the answer. It is stored in the garage for overflow &amp; bulky items. Hope it will have the longevity we need. We've only had it a little...
, Better than expected, larger than thought, GREAT, FAST shipping. Perfect size and functionality for family that needs extra storage space!
, This purchase was perfect for my family. The setup was simple it only needs pluged in and wait until the temp drops then fill it. It is a very quite unit. I am glad there is a light on it that indicates it is on or I wouldn't know it.

, Doing laundry is enjoyable with this LG product. The features are easy to use and the digital display is large and clear, making it easy to read! I use it daily and am pleased with it's performance. Very happy since April!
, I knew that I wanted a LG brand dryer based on their reputation, so I researched all LG dryers before deciding on this model. Because of all the great reviews, I purchased this dryer in May 2012 along with the WM2650HWA washer and the matching pedestal...
, I love this dryer. My laundry is done in no time. Wish I had made this purchase years ago.
, I had used LG washer, Air conditioner back in India. They had turned out to be great product. Products served their purpose. Washer is still going strong after 11 years and Air Conditioner is great after 4 years use. This is very low sound product, whe...
, My old (10+ yrs) dryer broke and could not be repaired and my 20 year old washer was on its way out...so we entered the bewildering washer and dryer market. After a lot of research, we decided on this dryer and its matching front-load washer, and I hav...
, I've had my set about two months now and I love them. It's nice to have such a universal washer and dryer that you can clean so many different things with and the steam option allows you to sanitize as well! The only thing I don't like is the alert at ...
, Our LG dryer dries our clothes in NO time! The steam works very well at getting wrinkles out. We are VERY pleased with our purchase!
, Finally able to dry shoes and other items not meant to be tumbled on the drying rack. Steam feature a bonus. All else is as expected.
, We recently purchased this product and absolutely love it. The features are great and we've received several compliments from friends on the look.
, I've always preferred Gas Dryers over electric and thought they did a better job of drying but since I don't have gas in my new place I had to get an electric drier. This one dries even large loads a lot quicker than I expected and I guess it has a dry...
, This is the match to my washer. So quit I can run it with the laundry room door open. All the reviews are on the money for the most part. Use the manuals and online has great advice. My ELECTRIC bill is less now. Never would have guessed a system could...

, Very pleased with 5 burners and grill. Does an excellent job with baking. Only thing missing is a range-top light. Definitely recommend it!

, This range exceeds our expectations, very happy with the quality of the product and it's features. The outstanding design is the greatest strength of this range. The oven does very well, including some wonderfully oven temperatures.
, Love the looks and the functionality of the stove and oven. Easy to clean. But on my 3rd set of knobs for the stove, inside plastic piece keeps breaking. Very frustrating and disappointing. Metal inserts would have been MUCH better.
, We really love the stove - the blue interior is stunning and brings Awwwwwww from everyone who sees it! Only recommendation would be to offer the option of griddle for the middle burner.
, This product cooks very well and is very easy to operate and clean which were all important to me. On the other had it is abit difficult to set the temperature of the oven and clock.

, Laundry is a pleasant task with this sophisticated but easy to use dryer. I can multi-task and the dryer prevents my clothes from becoming wrinkled, and there seems to be a cycle for any type of washable fabric.
, This dryer is simple to use and takes half the time to dry your clothes if you are using the matching washer. The dryer itself does not cost any more than other top of the line dryers. It is extra if you want the pedestal to put it on. Overall I am...
, We have no complaints about this dryer. It has many cycle options. Figuring out how to turn off the alarms that indicate a cycle is complete was a little confusing at first.
, The features this washer has is amazing considering that I have 6 members in my family and they all are very involved in school activities so that means lots of laundry this takes care of it all.
, I'm a single guy - I'm hard on washers/dryers. I overload them, wash/dry things I shouldn't. And this dryer has handled everything I've thrown at it! Love the steam dry touch up for those loads that have been left in the dryer for a week or so and...
, I've had this dryer 6 months now & I love it. It dries quickly & quietly. My only issues with the dryer is that the start button sticks and there's been a couple times now when I started it & before I could walk out of the laundry room I heard it...
, You think your clothes, are going to be ruined forever? No, your wrong, It not only cleans, saves energy and most of all saves your clothes, and they come out like new every time!

, I paired this dryer up with it's high efficiency washer companion and I have been totally satisfied with their performance. Even when drying nine pairs of jeans using the denim cycle they came out completely dry and almost wrinkle free. The auto...
, I have owned several washers and dryers but these exceeds them all. I bought a new washer and dryer this summer and am just amazed at the performance and detail of this dryer. My clothes are always dry in a fraction of the time!! Would recommend it to...
, This dryer is as easy to use as the matching washer. My seven year old can use this without wrinkling all the clothes. The Wrinkle prevent cycle is helpful when you can't attend to the dryer right away and is still more energy efficient than other...
, Enormous capacity holds full wash loads. I'm very pleased with how soft the clothes feel when the cycle is done. Not over-dried. The chimes were cute for he first 10 seconds, then quickly became an annoyance. Thankfully, they are easy to switch off....
, Great design and plenty of space- very efficient! Recommend to everyone with busy daily life!
, this is my third pair of maytag washer and dryer. i highly recomend anything maytag or kitchenaide
, Previously I had a Front Load LG set. I had nothing but trouble with it. If I had not had a 5 year extended warranty I would have spent a fortune in repairs. After the warranty ran out and it started failing again I purchased the Maytag Set. Trouble...
, This is the best dryer we have owned! I love the auto refresh and don't find myself folding as much as I used to. Looks great! I get lots of compliments on it! I would recommend it!
, Coupled with the Maxima washer what a performance package. This dryer drys. Easy to use and loaded with features,like a rack for drying sneakers(option), auto sensing that stops the unit when clothes dry before time runs out ( Eco friendly ).
, Has the ability to wash almost everything.. Would recommend this item. Controls easily used...

, My kids thought it was a new TV for almost a month. Looks cool, sleek and modern without being flashy. Easy, intuitive buttons & control system. Nice sounds for alarms, etc.
, I love my new machines. Gentle on clothes, cleans thoroughly. Even if I pack it full clothes come out fresh and clean. The stain removing option works great. The dryer is fast and quiet, works great. Drys clothes in about half the time my old ones did.
, My former Maytag dryer lasted 15 years...and I hated to replace it. However, this dryer is awesome -- it dries the clothes faster, it is much quieter, and obviously has many more features than the old one. I would buy this product again without question.
, i always set the wrinkle prevention for it, and it only tosses the load every 10 minutes or so, but still does the trick. love that its not using a ton of energy on my procrastination. when you do screw up your nice dress shirts or pants, the steam...
, This dryer does an amazing job! I don't think I will ever be able to fill it up - the large capacity is unbelieveable! My favorite feature is the steam option. Throw in dry clothes and the wrinkles/odors come out in about 15 minutes. I will definitely...
, I purchased the Maytag washer and dryer front loaders and love them. I have never had a problem with the set. Highly recommended for families. I'm a mother of 2 and have tons of laundrey to do daily. Great for washing sheets and comforters as well.

, Love the dryer just like the matching washer! Easy to operate, great cycle selection with excellent features!
, I absoutely love this dryer and also the matching washer. My husband's work clothes are very thick and our old dryer took 2 cycles to throughly dry them. But not this one, just one cycle and they are completely dry. Another great feature is the steam....
, Dries clothes very quickly. Very large capacity, can fit huge load of towels and blankets with no problem. Very quiet
, 319$ for a control board after4 years of service Just the price you pay to test drive their machine
, This item also works great but I wish the doors were reverseable.

, Love the new dryer and the large size. The new steam feature really works great ! I had a few issues with the tub rubbing against the side and making a noise but it was fixed in no time. It does cost a little more but well worth it.

The large capacity was the enticing factor and it has fulfilled our needs. I was highly impressed with the engineering that went in to this washer and had spent a few loads observing the action through...
, We love everything about it, so my husband says. He likes it so much he want let me wash clothes.
, The reason I bought this washer because it had the highest ratings for the price range I was looking at. The washer has performed flawlessly since it was purchased. Very Happy with my purchase.
, Unbelievable agitation of clothing. Everything got clean, including dirty diapers, king size comforter, delicates. Chhose a gentler spin than you think you should because it REALLY spins-almost dry.Only complaint - cannot change your mind about...
, LOVE IT pretty much sums it up. Quiet, saves water, cleans good, and HUGE capasity!
, This is a quiet, efficient, large capacity washer. It does every cycle imaginable -and handles a king size comforter with ease !! You can even create your own cycle if needed for special care items. Would recommend this washer to everyone. Get the top...
, doesnt seem to do a good job .never has enough water .just dont care for this washer
, 4 yrs ago i purchase a Whirlpool Cabrio, I was please at first until after 1yr & 2 repairs I was upset. My warranty was finished last year 2011 so last month it needed repair AGAIN!!!. The UL lights & spinning cycle was going to cost me $600.00. I said...
, so far this is the best washer I have ever had...so quiet and the clothes come out less wrinkled from the wash. LOVe it
, Overall it's a good washer. I know the water level might be low but the spinner did a good job rotating the clothes bottom to the top.
, We have had this product for a month and I have been very pleased with the settings and features. I read the manual before using it and do not overload it. I use liquid detergent but I also put in Oxyclean at times and items really come out looking...
, We have consulted many store sales person befor purchasing this production and loved it. Overall great product for family.
, We sometimes wonder if the machine is really running, it's SO quiet! Our old machine was so loud that you didn't want to run it during any family time like meals or TV watching. The Samsung's huge capacity is a real bonus for us. Our laundry pile is...
, After reading about the problems with smelly doors on some front loaders I decided to go with a top loader. I have been looking at buying a new washer and dryer for months. I had been putting it off because my old machines worked, just not really well....
, in summary....-Best Buy service and delivery was great.-Washer doesn't use enough water for most cycles to even get 1/2 load completely wet, therefore can't be used as recommended.-I called Samsung for support-- very nice, but the technician who was...
, quit dispensing water after 3 weeks of use. checked everything the manual said to check. still will not dispense water, 3 days before Christmas with company coming for the holidays, wonderful. also best buy upped the price 200.00 since thanksgiving sale.
, First of all, I'm very happy with Best Buy's delivery and installation service. They also removed my old machine, without extra charge.The first day I used it I was very upset because the water level was so low that was not able to cover the clothes....
, They installed it this moring and I was very happy. It ran great on an empty run that I did while the best buy crew was here just to make sure it worked. I didnt have any HE detergant so I waited till later after I hade a chance to pick up the correct...
, beutiful design, reasonable price, very quiet,.....
, There are a lot of comments on this washer. I read them all as well as consumer reports ( best buy recomendation). I dont really want to repeat all of the gripes regarding water level. Yes the water level is not the same as a traditional washer, but...
, This machine was just what we were looking for. Yes its quiet, but it doesnt destroy my clothes like my old washer did!! My clothes are treated so delicately yet cleaned so thoroughly. Best bang for your buck!
, Ive only had this unit for less than a week, but have done about ten loads so far to catch up on almost two weeks of having no washer and dryer. (My fault for originally ordering it to the wrong address.) Due to the setup, the delivery men were unable...
, We bought this washer after having an old-style standard agitator model forever. We still wanted a top loader but wanted to go HE. We reviewed other HE top loaders in a lower price range and they all seemed to have low ratings. This washer is easy to...
, Ive read ALOT of reviews AFTER I purchased this product. Stupid me. The main issue I had with this unit was the water temperature. Like the others said, the water does NOT get hot. Samsung tried to tell me the water heats up while its washing. Wrong! I...
, I have had this machine for a month or two and so far I love it. It uses less water, is quite, and the clothes are clean.
, I love this washer! I can do big loads enabling me to get my laundry done quickly! I have teenage kids so I have a lot of laundry. It gets things clean. I was worried after reading other reviews about the water level not being enough but it is fine. It...
, This is my first HE machine and Im very happy with my purchase. It has a large capacity and is very quiet - sometimes I check to make sure its working because its so quiet. I was skeptical because it uses less water and the HE detergent doesnt suds up...
, I have had this washing machine for less than 1 month and I am on washing machine #2! I am returning the 2nd one along with the dryer (I will not have mismatched washer and dryer). The washing machine will NOT wash rugs or blankets without getting off...
, Overall we enjoy this washing machine, it does a great job washing clothes, uses plenty of water etc we havent had many of the problems that you might see people ranting about, most of which boil down to reading the users manual.. The one major problem...
, This was the #1 consumer rated washing machine as of the date of my purchase. I replaced my 6-year-old front loaders and purchased these Samsung top loaders. I am completely satisfied. The new Samsung washes clothes better and there is no more dirty...
, Common sense and reality prove that this washer cannot possibly clean clothes. If you watch this machine in action(?), you will see that the clothes are never completley covered by water and, more importantly, are never moved from the position in which...
, This is the best washer I've ever had!! Inexpensive for what you get. Cut my loads from 5 to 3. Very Quiet as well. I forget its running. Thank you Samsung!!
, I replaced a 12 year old agitator washer with the Samsung. The Samsung is very quiet, and seems to be working as designed. Much different than old agitator washers, so you have to get used to something completely different. Not cheap, but not as...
, Excellent washer, has all the cycles needed for any kind of laundry, a Quality product and easy to use. Highly recommended at a great price, and a superb value.
, I had a front loader and I was not happy with it. So finally decide to get a new washer machine did my research and this washer machine had good reviews. Also Lowe's online was great. Got the washer the next day can't beat fast service. Also they...
, i have only had it for a month now but i love this washer the capacity is enormous i i gave it the test yesterday and loaded three times the amount of clothes then my old (large capacity) mach and it did a beautiful job it seems like it does not fill...
, I researched for about two weeks trying to figure out if I was going to get a front or a top loader. Having four friends with leaky front loaders pushed me towards a top loader. Reading review after review of people who are having their clothes twisted...
, I purchased this washer for the large wash capacity, 4.7. Normal loads work great. However, when I wash my king size sheets and summer blanket when it is ready to spin, the machine stops and starts filling back up. I rearrange the load and again upon...
, I've had this washer for about a week now and I LOVE IT...You would not believe the size of the drum. Only complaint I have is that I can not reach the bottom to fish out the stray sock or wash rag..lol. It is super quiet and seems to do a great job....
, I was skeptical at first buying a washer without an agitator. However, I knew I wanted a washer that would handle my large blankets/bedspreads from my queen sized bed. My clothes are coming out clean, drying time is less and I believe less water is...
, Lots of useful features. I was leary about not having a agitator but after seeing how this machine work and how clean the cloths came out. All the settings work very well. When spinning there is no viberation at all. Quiet
, Washing machine is quiet and has a lot of options that you can tune to what you want. It even remembers the changes you make to the cycle for your next load. It is quiet, cleans well, and I know I am saving a lot of water and electric!! And the...
, This is my first HE washer, and I was a bit nervous after reading some mixed reviews. We've had it now for three weeks and so far, so good. The machine is quiet, easy to use, large capacity and our clothes are clean. I've learned to use the correct...
, I got this washer when my dryer broke down. I had a Whirlpool Cabria for a few years and because of a flaw in their design inside, if I missed any coins from pockets they would slip down through a gap and get into the water pump. The coins, during the...
, Excellent machine that is much better than the LG front loading washer I have owned the past 5 years. The Samsung washer is much more quiet than the LG front loader I had. My clothes are getting much cleaner too. Controls and settings are easy to...
, This machine has great features, is easy to use, and is very quiet.
, I recently purchased this washer and would highly recommend it! Before purchasing, I read all the consumer reviews and feel that they helped me in making my decision. The one negative I kept seeing was that some buyers felt that their clothes did not...
, This machine does not function as advertised, I do not suggest that anyone purchase it if they need to wash with hot water. There is no way to get hot water on the normal wash cycle, even though it's an option to select that.
, I put off getting a new washer because I was afraid I couldn't control the water level and also afraid the clothes would be a twisted, knotted mess. My daughters friend recommended this washer so I finally made the decision to go ahead and replace...
, After years of terrible washing machines, we really needed a new washer. We wanted one that actually cleaned clothes! This machine received high ratings from Consumer Reports, and it was a great value, so we decided to give it a whirl. We're so...
, We have a king size bed and pets. This washer has the capacity and the strength to work for us. The only problem with the design is the it seems perfect for a tall person (I am not). I need a step stool to reach the bottom to scoop out my laundry.
, I bought this washer and returned it in less than a week. This washer has control, not the user. There is no water level setting and the sensored level does not add enough water to rinse clean. An extra rinse is required even with a teaspoon of HE...
, Beautiful washer. Works great and fun to use. HOLDS EVERY LOAD, even my comforter comes out clean, Giant tub ,Thanks Lowes for help getting it.
, On the fence with this one. Appears to run more than old one. Not sure about savings on water or electric yet. First load was small noticed cleaner socks. Tried a king mattress pad, one reason for buying this. The water would not cover pad, nor splash...
, I have had this washer for over one month now, I love it no issues so far. Love the sanitize feature for my steam mop pads cleans them so well. Very large capacity with no agitator. One of my favorite features is the music when the wash cycle is done.
, Ok, I'll start by telling you that I NEVER write reviews. For anything!! I always read them, but never write them. My 10 year old Kenmore went out last week, and since we were out if town the rest of the week, I waited until we got back to look for a...
, My wife and I wanted to get a top load for the huge capacity and to avoid some of the drawbacks of the front loaders we had for years. This is a nice unit, love the clear top, it is very quiet and doesn't have annoying buzzers for signals. However; it...
, I absolutely love my washer! Talk about large ... quiet ... and efficient! I can wash over two times the clothers as I could in my old washer! When I first got it ... I would often check on it to make sure it was even running ... it was so quiet! I was...
, It is very user friendly, you give it very basic commands, and it does the rest. It will weight the clothes, then determine how much water is needed to clean the clothes. So don't expect the drum to fill up. The washer can tell how much water it...
, I purchased this washer over Labor Day weekend as my old washer was dying on me. Well it took over three weeks to receive it which gave me way too much time to read all the reviews-all over the internet. Something I normally do prior to purchasing an...
, Nice unit and performs well. Haven't found any downsides as of yet.
, Have had for about a month and love it. It's quiet , cleans clothes and has lots of options !!
, I do not llike this washer at all. My clothes come out smelling like I never washed them. I have tried everything. I have switched cycles, softner, detergent, crystals, extra detergent. I have even tried adding more water once it has filled up. I...
, I love this machine, It's quite and does the job right. I love watching how my load of clothes soak down once the water hits them and shift them around. The only thing I would like to see most is sudz. I never see sudz no matter how many cups of...
, We have a very large family. There are 9 of us that live in our home on a regular basis. Plus, we have several others that come and stay anywhere from 1 day to 2 weeks at a time. This washer has NO problem handling the wash load of a family our size....
, We were excited about this washer! It looks great, spins great, unfortunately it doesn't wash well. Our clothes would barely move during the wash cycle therefore no friction to clean clothes, also the water didn't cover the clothes. Then our clothes...
, I love my new wash machine! I have a shirt that has had deoderant build up in the armpits of the shirt that my old machine would never get out. I have washed it in different temperatures, I would even let it sit with Spray N Wash for a period of time...
, Could not wait to get the Kenmore out of my house, love this machine so far, very very quiet, Cleans clothes very well.
, I bought this washing machine 4-21-12 and I am loving it!! My old washer was not properly cleaning the clothes or spinning enough to get the water out. It was taking 2-3 cycles to dry our clothes. I knew it was not the drier as it is relatively new....
, There are several cycles that offer hot water- normal, heavy duty, towels and bedding. The only cycles that my machine would wash with hot water in were the towels and bedding cycles. The other two when set on hot presented only cool to mildly warm end...
, The WA5451ANW is a great washer and does all that is supposed to do. It is quiet and efficient and does a good job of getting the clothes clean.
, I totally HATE this washer! I wish I had gone with the front loader. My clothes don't get clean and they don't smell good. I had a repairman come out and check it out. He told me the government forced the efficiency on us. Save water... Of course...
, I went from a small whirlpool to this monster! I can do three loads from the whirlpool in this machine in only one wash. My husband works outside all day and is required to wear fire resistant clothes; I also have two boys under the age of 6, with that...
, Our old Maytag, (a made in Newton, Iowa model), died after only 6 years. Constantly had water pumps going out and other problems. So we went to Lowes to see what could replace the old tried and true made in USA. We looked at about 20 units, didn't...
, I have owned this machine for a week and hate it. If I could figure out how to over ride the water level I would love it. It is supposed to know how much water to use. I have torn garments because there was not enought water. At least give the...
, Easy to use controls, plenty of setting selections incl. hand washables & bedding, HUGE capacity - can wash twice as much if not more in one load compared to my last washer, overall very smooth operation - very quiet and knobs and lid are just smooth....
, Have had this one for about three months. This washer is quiet. My old Maytag was not. It does a great job on larger loads than i could previously do. I don't do extremely large loads but the ones i do are probably double what i am used to. Clothes...
, This machine's performance is a big disappointment. Does not clean well; does not rinse well using HE detergent. Machine does not seem to move clothes around enough to clean. Same items remain on top of load entire wash cycle. Tons of lint on items on...
, Great price, with all the features we needed! Price was amazing!
, I bought this washer one month back and we are very happy with the performance. Even though the price seam to be on the higher end, its worth for the size.
, We love our washer and dryer! I admit, I toyed with the idea of a frontload pair but I kept hearing the horror stories about the bad smells, leaking machines, and lackluster performance. Yes the frontloads look great and modern but you get style and...
, Our first one had a bracket on the bottom break in under 24 hours. It shook the whole house and required hearing protection and that is not embellishing at all.
, I spent a lot of time researching washing machines before buying one to replace our ancient washer & dryer. I read reviews about top loaders not getting clothes clean or as clean as the front loaders. The first load I washed happened to be white...
, I am not good at change. I had a high effieicency previously, it just stopped working. I bought this Samsung based on ratings and reviews. While these items probably would not have changed my purchase, I wish that I had known before buying that: - it...
, So nice to have a smart washer. Just tell it the kind of things you are putting into it and it will do the rest. No more guessing whether you have a large load. Lots of room so fewer loads are possible. Very quiet and a nice melody to tell you it is...
, I absolutely love this washer. I have not had any problems with water level, clothes being torn or wrinkled. I read through the entire manual before I used it the first time. My clothes are cleaner than they have ever been. My comforters and sheets...
, Just received the washer today and find that this is the best washer. The quality is fantastic, it is so quiet you don't even realize it is running. Huge tub to hold heavy items such as pillows and they are clean!--not full of soap -rinsed very well...
, This washing machine is the best I've ever had!!! Washes clean and doesn't go unbalance when washing a lot of towels. It's very quiet. The only noise you hear is the water moving around.
, We had our last washer for nearly 15-years and it was time to get a new one. Well, we checked Consumer Reports, and after reviewing the pros/cons of front loading vs top loading, we went with this one: Consumer's top pick for front loading washers!...
, I purchased this top loader to replace a 6yr-old front loader Whirlpool Duet that was broken and not worth fixing anymore. Prior to the Whirlpool, I had had Kenmore and Maytag front loaders for the past 15 years. I liked the idea of front loaders but...
, You can't go wrong with this washer. After quite a bit of research, we bought the set. Amazing how much you can put in the washer and how quickly you can dry the load. I haven't had any problems with wrinkling, the clothes come out clean and fresh-...
, I really cant believe all the questions about the water level and people still getting dirty clothes. You really have to read and understand the manual plus understand how this machine works. It cleans cloths great with alot less water. You have to...
, Easy to use. Very quiet and cleans everything. Extra large capacity makes laundry duties go quickly.
, Replaced an old kenmore with this washer and dryer set. Clothes come out much fresher smelling and cleaner. Machine is very quiet. I only hear the occasional sound of water.
, I was unsure about this unit after reading some reviews, but everywhere I read the reviews they were always 85-90% good and that VERY small percent that was negative. So I went ahead and got it. SO GLAD I DID! This is a excellent washer! I couldnt ask...
, This washer is very quite, it does a grate washing job. I have other Samsung products and have been very satisfied with them all. I find there to be good quilty in all of them.
, I purchased this washer a month ago when my old washer died at the age of 5 years. I based this purchase primarily on the other reviews I had read, combined with the lack of consistently good reviews for what I had always thought were the good washer...
, Hands down, this thing is brilliant. I love the efficient use of water, so that I don't have to find ways to stuff all of my laundry in one load to save money. The settings make it so easy to use and the fun signal at the end of the cycle is...
, Easy to use, huge capacity has cut in half the amount of loads I do per week.
, This product has many features that make it very versatile to operate! I would recommend this product to everyone I know!
, This washer not only look great but cleans the clothes great. Love the automatic setting
, Purchased this washer and matching dryer almost 4 weeks ago and am returning both this weekend. It does not wash my comforters as the sale person stated it would. Washed 3 times and sections of the comforters STILL stained and smelled stale afterwards....
, The washer is amazing! It is so quiet when washing and sings to you when it's done. My clothes come out very clean. I really hated my old washer quitting but this washer is a work of art.
, Was a little nervous making the change to this style tub, but it has exceeeded our expectations. You can get a ton of clothes washed adn it is quiet. We have the unit upstairs and our old tub style used to shake the house, but htis one sounds smooth....
, this washer is amazing, it is worth the cash. i bought it a couple days ago and it arrived yesterday. it gets clothes incredibly clean, uses auto sense for water level so no forgetting to change the level, straightforward design and simple controls...
, It's a fine machine, but if you're placing it in on an uneven floor, be forewarned that the rear corners can't be adjusted for level. You'll have to use shims. Too bad on a beautiful look to have wood sticking out.
, Great washing machine. I was originally concerned by reviews that said the machine did not provide enough water to wash clothes. There are settings that will provide more water if you need it. My clothes seem cleaner now. The machine has great...
, Just bought the Samsung WA5451 and we love it! It is very quiet, the clothes get clean and smell great. Love the size of the drum.
, So quiet we have to check on it to make sure it is working.
, Bought this washer a week ago. Replaced a 12yr old Maytag. I was concerned about moving to a HE washer due to all the people talking about how they do not get clothes clean. Well this washer does a fantastic job. The Mrs. loves it. As far as HE washers...
, WANTED A LARGE CAPACITY WASHER, THIS ONE IS HUGE BUT THE ENERGY SAVING ISSUE ISN'T WORTH IT, IT WOULDN'T PUT ENOUGH WATER ON THE CLOTHES TO WASH THEM, THEY WOULD COME OUT DIRTY , OR MY COMFORTERS WOULDN'T EVEN GET WET ON TOP, AND IT DOESN'T...
, This replaced a 10-12 year old Kenmore elite with Calypso. Considering what I paid for that elite when it first came out, this washer was a bargain! The elite worked well but got to the point where it just was not cleaning. We considered front loaders...
, I looked and read and compared. yes it does cost some, but rememeber you get what you pay for and this is something you use everyday you want it for the long haul. It does not shake rattle or jump around like those front load units I had. this unit is...
, This washer is so quiet you dont even know its running, easy to get an king size blanket in to washer.
, I used my frontloader until I couldn't stand it any longer.... I searched online for a top loading washer. I am very happy with this washer. It does not tangle up my clothes as the frontloader did, our clothes are so clean, love the sanitizing...
, I have had bad experiences with other brands. The salesperson suggested Samsung. I had not had an HE washer before and was not interested in the front loader. I decided to buy the top loader. The washer is very quiet, interesting to watch the wash...
, Had to replace my Whirlpool Calypso,so looked for another HE washer,went to several sites and read reviews on Top Loading machines, this washer was always on top,even went to Good Housekeeping. It might be pricey but the features are worth it.
, I waited a few months to write a review as I really wanted to test the washer. Like so many other people I just didn't think there was enough water to properly wash our clothes. However, I too now put most of our clothes on the bedding cycle which...
, We have used nearly every type of cycle on this machine, and it consistently performed well. Based on some reviews, we were concerned that this washer would not supply enough water for proper washing at some cycle settings. But, the washer has supplied...
, I was a little hesitant to move to HE, but I have had great previous experiences with Samsung, so when our washer went out we decided to give these a try. They are on the expensive side, as are most other HE machines. I wanted a top loader due to the...
, I have had this washing machine now for about a week. This is my first HE product. I must say....I miss the old technology! The ease of picking water levels, changing the temperature, and stopping the washer mid-cycle to make changes is no more! The...
, This is a replacement washer for our agitator washer lost to a power surge from the tornado which hit our home. A neighbor had told me that her front loader high efficiency washer would often damage her lighter weight knits. Not so with this...
, only have had the washer 3 weeks but am very impressed, first he washer and already our clothes are cleaner. Would recommend this product or any samsung product, we also have the matching dryer, a samsung 50 dlp tv, and a samsung blue ray player.
, have had this only 2 weeks and I love it..especially the sizo of the drum. Just washed my kingsize comforter with no problem!
, After reviewing everything about this washer I confirmed it was the best washer for me. I love the see through lid and the 4.7 cu ft capacity. I wanted the ability to wash my king comforter, which it does no problem.
, I just received the washer and dryer yesterday, so I've only washed a few loads. I like that it has such a large capacity, and uses so little water, but I don't like that it locks when it starts to wash, and you have to go through a few movements to...
, Lowes price match was great here. A competitor had the same machine on sale for 30% less, but they didn't have it in stock and wouldn't for a while. The Lowes salesman matched it and was very helpful and courtieous. Delivery was also perfect. They...
, So far I am very pleased with this washer. Lowes delivered it and installed it. I originally had planned on getting a front loading washer, but I realized that if I got the pedestals as well they would not fit under the cabinets in my laundry room. So,...
, This machine was highly recommended by the salesperson and ts loaded with features. When I purchased it 6 month ago there weren't many reviews. It is a very attractive machine, and I love the sound it makes when the cycle is complete. However, it does...
, Think first about buying a top loading washer. This machine as told by the salesperson, was top rated as energy efficient, used the same amount of water as the front loader. This is not true at all. This washer used 49 gallons of water to perform a...
, I researched for months before I bought this machine! I am so happy I got this big oversized top loading Samsung. The clothes come out amazing and love that it will handle king size bed clothing which I use to have to take out to have cleaned. My...
, We bought the Samsung at Lowes in the fall of 2011. We found this washer makes holes in clothes and tears apart washing even on gentle/delicate cycles. It will destrory towels and linens. We have owned top load and front load washers and we have never...
, ... not a need. So my hubby bought the set for me for Valentine's day. I really love this set so far. I got them yesterday, and I've done quite a few loads. The only reason I didn't go 5 stars all the way is because it is very deep. I have to call...
, I bought this machine when my Kenmore broke about 2 months ago. This is my first HE machine, and I really wanted a top loader to avoid having to buy a stand or crouching down to get clothes in and out of the washer. I like the top loading feature, and...
, It's a fine machine, but if you're placing it in on an uneven floor, be forewarned that the rear corners can't be adjusted for level. You'll have to use shims. Too bad to spoil a beautiful look with wood sticking out.
, I wanted a front load washer to be in style, since they now seem to be the washer of choice, but I knew that I had a habit of adding clothes so it wasn't really the best choice for me. As it turns out, the space I have did not allow for one, so I...
, Just bought this unit a few weeks ago. I love the way the machine washes and the many features this unit has. It was a little more money vs the other guys out there, but I have heard good things about their laundry. I was a little sceptical when I took...
, I purchased this washer even though some reviews indicated it did not fill with enough water to cover clothes. It sure doesn't! I watched two loads go through the entire wash cycle without the sweathsirt on top even getting wet! I am all for high...
, Water level is a problem. I trick it by adding a bit of water prior to turning on the Power. It thinks the clothes are heavier than they are. Clothes do come clean.
, I recently purchased this washer and have fallen in love. It is everything it states it is. It washes the clothes clean and quickly. It uses the right amount of water, not too much or too little. Sometimes, I forget it on, that's how quiet it is and I...
, I read plenty of reviews on washing machines before I purchased this model. The high ratings were hard to ignore for this machine. I went from having an 15 year old 3.4 cu.ft. to this nice big Samsung WA5451 HE Top load machine and it's a night and...
, Usually a decent machine, but for certain types of wash, it goes into an endless loop of rinsing. We are afraid to leave the machine running unsupervised not knowing if it will ever stop. We ARE using recommended detergent and detergent amount. 6 weeks...
, Overall we enjoy this washing machine, it does a great job washing clothes, uses plenty of water etc we haven't had many of the problems that you might see people ranting about, most of which boil down to reading the users manual.. The one major...
, The washing machine is very similar to the machine I bought for my apartment Japan. This is why I choose the Samsung. The only problem I have with the machine is with the soap dispenser. There should be a signal when its not snapped tight. This a very...
, I have several Samsung products and the quality and efficiency surpasses all expectations. I must admit I am short and need a step stool to reach the bottom of the tub. The first feature I used was the Heavy Duty with clothes caked in mudd/dirt from...
, Liked the washer from the start. Great ratings and from a respected manufacturer. Once the price was cut by 19% and we threw in the 10% coupon, it felt like we stole this machine. Got the matching dryer for the same deal. Score!!
, This unit quit draining over a week ago. A tech came out the next day, checked the pump and said it was fine, he needed to order a main board for the unit, said they would overnight it and be back out in a couple of days. The part came in several days...
, I love the Samsung washer. The delay start is awesome. I set it before I go to bed and the clothes are finished before I get up in the morning. It is great for a five family household. Love it!!!
, Love the large loads and ease of operation. Quiet too.
, Uses too little water and therefore does not clean anything that is very dirty. The only way I have found around this issue is to wash everything on the Bedding setting, it puts in a little more water then. I have also added a bucket of water myself....
, I read the reviews on this washer, both positive and negative. Decided to purchase it. Convinced some owners were disgruntled because they did not follow the instructions in the owners manual. It is High Efficiency, which is what I wanted. Some loads...
, After reading A LOT of different reviews on A LOT of different washers I was very skeptical and undecided as to what type of washer to buy - a front loader? A top loader HE? Honestly I didn't believe the top loader HE would perform all that well...
, Excellent washmachine,wife truly does love her new washmachine,has great features,quiet operation,and really easy to use(user friendly),a little pricey but you do honestly Get what you pay For.Thanks Samsung.
, I really like my Samsung 4.7 cu. ft. Top Load Washer. I had read many reviews - both the very high rated reviews through the very low rated reviews on this machine and other machines - in order to make my decision. I am glad I had decided to buy this...
, Outstanding Washing Machine, Noise level is good, removes almost all the water out of the laundry during high speed spin cycle. I enjoy the Music instead of the old buzzer at the end of the wash cycle.
, First washer and dryer (same type) we bought for our new home. LOVE THEM!!! You can absolutely pack the washer and it cleans like a dream and they are both so quiet! Simple to use and you can adjust the settings to whatever you would like. THe only...
, We weren't sure of this new water conserving' technology for washing machines, so we got a middle-of-the road priced Maytag and it was horrible. It didn't clean the closes, it was loud as heck and it wrinkled the clothes so badly. So we returned it...
, I Love this washer. Only been 3 days but i like how it operates. I like the choices of settings it gives me. I read the manual and it's really easy to operate. I like the way it spins the most of the water out and my clothes spend alot less time in...
, The washer works great. It's very quiet. My water bill went down immediately. The only downside is that it will leaves clothes twisted together more than I would like when the load is complete.
, Hauling all my king sized comforters to the laundromat was a dreaded task. I would wait until I had none left before I would go there. Using those commercial loaders never seemed to clean my comforters or get the total smell of my dogs out. I hesitated...
, Bought this cause most of the reviews were good. Should of read all of them now that I have it , I went back and read more and I am with the ones that say it doesnt wash your cloths very good the ones on top dont get clean even if I dont do a big load...
, I HATE this washer. I've not bought a more dreadful appliance than this Samsung washer. It does not clean the clothes or the towels or the bedding. The water doesn't even cover the clothes. The agitation is so minimal as to be ridiculous. My clothes...
, I bought the Samsung Washer after having two really bad experiences with another major manufacturer. Samsung reviews were the best and it was recommended by the sales staff and the repair technician. We love the washing machine and the features it has...
, I have only used this machine for one week's laundry, but find it quite satisfactory. I do wish we had the option to not lock the lid -- without children in the house there isn't a concern. The cleaning ability was excellent as was the time to run...
, Overall, I like the washer. It's a little deep, hard for me to get clothes off the very bottom.
, Impressed with the ease of use. At this point an affordable product with many features I purchased specifically so that I could wash large loads - King size comforters and bigger loads to save on energy and water.
, Washes the clothes without twisting them. Love that they come out smelling clean. Does a great job.
, This washer is awesome. I bought the set because my Whirlpool frontloader broke after 6 years and it was going to cost $1000 to fix it. The washer is so quiet I had to go check to make sure it was running. The clothes came out by far cleaner than my...
, Purchased this washer last weekend, based on positive reviews, including JD Power. This is my first HE machine, replaced a 10 year old Maytag machine that was acting up. I was concerned about the the reviews I had read about how little water this...
, too loud. I feel the machine is going to brake
, We bought this product when our first son was born. We are using it every day. Everything is perfect and we love it. Thank you. thank you for delivery. The boys were very nice and talked to me about this product. They put the product where we wanted.
, This machine is very quiet in all parts of it's cycle. The clothes are clean. Also, it uses a very small amount of water, which will reduce my water bill.
, I love how I can set it and forget it! This washer is all I ever wanted and more! To be able to wash my bed sheets, pillow cases AND comforter all at the same time is WONDERFUL! Not to mention washing my darks, lights and whites in just 3 loads! And...
, I was tired of my towels smelling like mildew! This machine really takes care of that and much much more. I love it!
, We love this washer. We selected it based on Consumer Reports high rating. We have a Samsung fridge that we are really like and so we decided to take the leap on a second Samsung product. Our clothes are much cleaner than any machine we have had...
, We have only had the washer a few weeks, but so far I couldn't be happier! It is HUGE, quiet, and things are clean. With 5 of us, that's all I could ask for.

, Good value for a reasonable price. Got excellent customer service. Lots of convenient features for a family.
, WE GOT THIS JUST A FEW WEEKS BACK, BUT SO FAR, SO GOOD. ALWAYS BEEN PLEASED WIH SAMSUNG PRODUCTS.
, This refrigerator is performing great. I will like to update in 30 days
, We just bought our fridge. We love it, but as with anything it has faults. I love the LED lights, but they are borderline dim. Probably just used to our old incandescent bulbs. Love the temperature control you have over your food. The power cooling...
, Just got it installed today. If it works as great as it looks, i don't think we should have any problems..
, I bought i on 11/15/11 and the only thing I did find out is Keep the freezer on 0%. I found this out by the sales person who sold it to me, who owned one also. Otherwise the ice may stop working. Other than that is works great. I would recomend this...
, The fridge and freezer maintain consistent temperatures and seem to have more useable space than competitors. Care is needed in dispensing ice as it will sometimes drop a cube after releasing lever. Since there is no drain pan, water and ice can hit...
, Have minor problem with LED panel. Service came right out and ordered new panel. Waiting for install.
, Our old fridge was on it's way out, so before a crisis happened, we found this on sale. What a steal. We were shopping for a French Door model but this drew us right in. We've not had the problems with this ice maker that other reviewers have...
, After shopping around and around for the best deal, we found it...I started out shopping for a french door style and ended up convinced to buy this side by side. So far so good!!
, My wife and I love our new refrigerator, delivered in mid-March 2012, except for the problems we are having with the ice maker. It successfully made three batches of ice, just after we had it installed, and has not made any batch since. After a few...
, I bought this refrigerator on November 17, 2011 and received it on November 24, 2011. The purchase process was seamless. Then the nightmare started. After two weeks, the Ice-maker stopped working. Called Samsung customer support and followed their...
, After reading about so many models and reviews glad we went with the Samsung 265TD. Had it about 4 months and have had NO PROBLEMS. Ice maker and everythings works fine.
, This product is very quite. This product has great LED lighting This product has a user friendly control panel, on the exterior of refrigerator.Easy to use. So far we are very happy with this refrigerator
, well pleased with this product. for the money it had much more quality and niceties than any other brand we considered. Especially like the dual evaporators, icemaker in the door, glass shelves in the refrigerator AND freezer, and temperature control.
, Prior owner and satisfied customer. This Fridge is a major let down. On door ice maker only rates a poor for design and how it dispenses. Would not recommend this Fridge to anyone I like.
, I purchased this fridge 3 weeks ago, so its hard to give it 5 stars, but I hope that the quality holds up. I found that the size of this fridge is large enough for my family of 5. It can hold 9 big jugs of milk on the top drawer. It is very deep....
, We have only had this refrigerator for a few days. The ice machine is making very little ice and leaked water onto the floor. The ice holder fills with a big clump of ice, not cubes. We will call for service this Monday.
, I purchased this product 2 months ago. We recently had a power failure and when the power came back on, the ice maker would only dispense crushed ice. It would not dispense cubed ice. I notified the manufacturer, and was informed there were no...
, I love the sleek smooth front. It is quiet! It is functional! We have had no problems with it!
, I love this refrigerator. Great space. Love the ice maker on the door. I love the LED lighting. The only thing I would improve on with the lighting would be to have some lighting on the sides as well to more evenly distribute the light.
, I had a side-by-side fridge that was 15 years old, but still working and I decided to replace it. I looked and looked and the LED lighting on this Samsung is what sold me on this particular model, plus having the ice maker in the door. Unfortunately,...
, I would not reccommend purchasing this refridgerator. The features and appearance are very nice. After the first one was installed it started leaking. The retailer sent a tech to look at it and decided to replace it. The second one would not even cool....
, The refrigerator has performed up to our expectations except for the ice maker. A plus is that the volume of ice is good. Negative side is that the lever to obtain ice is difficult to push; I use my hand to press the lever due to concerned that glass...
, Good buy for the money. Refrigerator boxes keep getting bigger and the cubic feet larger, but less usable space each time we have to by one. Shelving could use more adjustment options to fit needs. Door shelves shape allows less small containers to be...
, quiet refrigerator.hard to find small items due to big tall items have to be stored in door.very nice looking refrigerator.
, seems to work well. keeps food cold and doesn't seem to run too much. lighting not the best.
, I bought the RS275 model but I think they're pretty much the same model except for size. The fridge and freezer cooled off quickly. The icemaker works as expected. I think the lighting is fine inside. The only downside so far (I've had the fridge about...
, I purchased a Samsung front load washer/dryer set a few years back and have been happy with them so I liked what I read about this refrigerator so I went for it, sight unseen I purchased it online. The biggest thing that sold me was the 5 year warranty...
, So far this Samsung has exceeded my expectations. Operation is quiet. Controls are easy to use and understand. Spill-proof shelves have come in hand on several occations already. Wine rack is also great for holding liter bottles of water. Weren't too s...
, samsung has created an excellent refrigerator that seems not to have any uneven cooling or freezing spots. stays steady at the temp. you set. does not transfer odors. ice always tastes good. has easy controls. water dispensing is really good. ice dispe...
, Overall I like it my my wife is still up in the air because she uses the ice and water that comes out of the door. The jamming of the ice maker affects her more than me.
, I love the way the refrigerator is illuminated, organized and many options for storing food in the various compartments.

, Always had an extra freezer for outside. This one looks great and appears to work well. Have not had it long so we shall see. Plenty of space in door.
, This freezer is perfect for me. It is unbelievably quiet. I love that there is a number lit up on the door telling me that the freezer is working properly and at the right temperature. It has a lock and key if I need it and an alarm when the door is op...
, I am quite pleased with the freezer, however, do think that three weeks is not long enough to own it for purposes of any truly discriminatory (+ or -) judgements.
, Thjis has been a blessing for us. We need space in the frig/freezer in our kitchen. We have a starter home, and d not have room for a large freezer. This is perfect. As our family grows, we will probably upsize to a large size in the same brand. The ...
, I am satisfied with this freezer and would buy this brand again.
, I like this freezer quite a bit. There is a lot of space & the price was right.   The only downsides: Shelves are pretty flimsy, as are the door bars. It is also a bit noisy, but I keep it in the basement & it doesn't bother me at all. Overall, I reall...
, I use it because I have a side by side refridgerator freezer that just doesn't hold all that much in the freezer. Now I have room for all our food.
, Nice Freezer and great service from ABT! First one that came was dented...ABT replaced it with no problem or hassle. Plenty of room as a second to our side be side. Based on other reviews would offer the following: 1. After a couple weeks it doesn't ru...
, Freezer is working great. I like the door alarm. I read bad reviews on the door lock, so I had to try it. The door lock worked, but I wouldn't want to use it alot. The freezer is a little noisy, but it is in the garage.
, Seems small in size compared to my old freezer yet really holds alot . I am very happy with it so far , it just seems a litttle loud but I am now used to that .
, THIS IS A REALLY NICE FREEZER FOR ME. I BAKE A LOT OF COOKIES TO GIVE AWAY TO FRIENDS,ESPECIALLY AT CHRISTMAS AND ALSO DURING THE YEAR. I REALLY LIKE THE WIRE BASKET AT THE BOTTOM. IT ALSO HAS A LIGHT INSIDE SO EVERYTHING IS VISIBLE. AND THE DIGITAL TE...
, I am satisfied with our purchase. It is a good value. I like the storage in the door, items don't slide out the bottom. Also bottom basket works easily. Nicely lighted, has door lock and LED display for temp. control. The unit is noisy. I would not rec...
, Great for what we need, but a little louder than expected. All in all, great value

, Liked the one I bought so much that I bought one for moms place. They all seem to come pre-dented so no worries about future mishaps. Does run very quitely. Requires a good tug on the door at times but seals perfectly.
, My freezer worked pretty well for 2 years and 1 month. It then died. Parts cost more than a new freezer. So much for the days a short time ago, or for other brands, where there is a 5 year warranty. Now shopping for another brand to replace this. I wil...
, Just received my unit yesterday and it is doing well. Got cold within 3 hours so was able to get my food in there right away. Other unit broke and all my food was in my side by side. Just made it. Good thing. Also, has basket on bottom, which we really...
, It is noisy, we have ours in garage and you can hear it in house. Looking for some kind of sound damping product that we can put behind it. Price it was worth it. Looked at several others in this size and they where pricey.
, The appliance is working well to date. Major kudos to the two young men who delivered it and set it in place. It is an outside appliance so noise has not been an issue.
, I wish i would have switched from my chest deep freeze to a stand-up sooner! I love it!
, I am glad I have this on my back porch. Even my Hubby commented saying, is it supposed to make so much noise. This freezer works great, love the bottom drawer and the door holders. The freezer keeps consistent temperature and I love the fact you can se...
, easy ordering,and really fast shipment. a good product for the price.
, This product is still very new so I would expect that it would perform well.  It holds a lot for a small freezer and I like the idea that is shows if the door is opened and shows if the temperature is right.
, Great price. Love the size. Fits so much stuff. Great freezer all over. Don't regret the choice we made. We store a lot if meat in it.
, We love our new freezer. It takes up less space than the old one but the space is much more usable. Could not be happier.
, It's a great freezer. It ha a light on the inside so you can see everything. It seems like it won't get iced up like the other one we had. But time will tell on that one. I'm happy with it.
, I'm a big fan of having things organized. Love that it has shelves & I don't have to bend over to find things.
, Great freezer has a lot of room. Very quite. The freezer was delivered to my home with no problems.
, We purchased this freezer for the garage. It does not take up much space, has plenty of shelves.
, Good freezer for use in basement but is really too loud to be used in living spaces. Like the door ajar alarm which comes in handy when kids accidentally don't close it all the way.
, awesome for the price and more than enough space for a family
, The features of this freezer are great. An alarm will sound when the door isn't closed and the digital read=out will let you know when the temperature rises.....
, We had a 35 year old freezer that was still working! But we knew it wouldn't be long before it would stop working so picked out this one & it works great & has plenty of room and is much more energy efficient than the old one.
, We have had this freezer for a month, and it is a great, no frills freezer. We like the wire shelving, which helps the cold air circulation. Our only complaint is that the door comes equipped with a tamper-proof lock, but there was no key in the packag...
, We bought this freezer for extra basement storage to mitigate extra trips to the butcher and grocer. It runs fairly quietly (it's located next to my dehumidifier in a furnished basement) and we've had no issues after a month of ownership. Plenty of roo...
, This was my first time experience, buying a freezer and I'm very pleased with my choice. It has lots of room but still fits nicely in my kitchen ( no treks out to the garage or basement )
, We already had a similar freezer and was so pleased with it we just went and bought another of the same. The price was the lowest available for comparative specifications.
, Lots of shelves. Door shelves. Bottom drawer. Easy to use. Attractive.
, We are pleased with how quiet this freezer is. It keeps the items frozen without freezed burn. The capacity is just what we needed for an extra freezer.
, Love my new freezer, would highly recommend this items
, Already had a service call. They are to bring a new fan to hopefully cut down on the noise
, GREAT CAPACITY FOR A SMALL PRICE. INTERIOR LIGHT NICE AND BRIGHT. IS KNOWN TO BE ENERGY EFFICIENT.
, Works well. Good value for the price. The noise level is a bit louder than we expected.
, The freezer was exactly what we were looking for. It was reasonably priced and the perfect size for the space we had.

, Does everything I was looking for, mid-size and upright.
, Great freezer for the price would recommend to anyone. I love how it seals shut real tight and I like the digital display
, Great size ,Energy efficient , Fair Price , Would Recommend to a friend just a good all around product that we are most happy with
, good freezer not loud at all also it has plenty of room for all my frozen items i love it
, It works. What can I say? The freezer I had broke after 4 years (same brand) and I needed a new one quickly. This one was available. I hope it lasts longer than the last one. I did like the fact that you could lock the door with a key, but the key is c...
, We bought this for an overflow freezer and it is in our condo. It is a little noisy when the compressor is running, and having it perfectly level is 100% essential to preventing a very bad vibration noise when the compressor runs (and I mean 100% level...
, I really like this freezer. It isn't as loud as other reviews have mentioned and my family is constantly in and out of it. I had a chest freezer for many years but was tired of digging thru it. Now I can see exactly what I have in the freezer.
, We are very happy with this freezer! It's the perfect size for storing all the frozen snacks I need for 2 tean aged boys. They never stop eating!!
, I Think so far, its a great freezer. but for that money it should come with a metal key, not plastic
, Overall a good buy. Using it as a 2nd freezer for venison - so trying not to open it a lot. You get what you pay for. It does keeps food very cold, but when it runs its a little noisy. Overall I'm happy with it.
, Love that I don't have to reach down and get the food I need. Now I can see everything that is in there. Don't have to rotate stuff.
, Only had it a short time. Very much like the convenience of the upright. Fits nicely into our porch space.
, It's a great freezer. Very spacious love the outside controls. Also the alarms are a plus. Chest freezer always seem to be the big thing. But I prefer the upright just more convenient and accessible.
, So far i love it! It was filled within a few weeks. Im so excited to have my food not ruin because my old freezer was broken! It was easy set up and i love having the lock! I have peace of mind that my kids cant get into it.
, My wife and were looking for a spare freezer and this ended up being the one between balance of features and size. The only issue if I had to find one is the compressor is a little loud when it runs but the freezer is in the basement and it goes unnoti...
, I love being able to utilize the shelves in this appliance as its set up just like a refrigerator. Unit is quiet for the most part.
, well what can i say it dose what it is supposed to do lol. haven had a problem with any of my Frigidaire products
, Large enough for my needs without being too big. Frost free is a great feature, since I keep the unit in the basement.
, It is alittle loud if you were to put it in your house. I have it in the basement and does ok down there. Plenty of room inside. I like the shelves on the door also.
, My wife and I really got tired of the bottom drawer freezer, so we decided to buy a stand-alone freezer. This is the smaller version, but it has been terrific to have the extra space. The performance is outstanding, even at a setting of 4 out of 7, eve...
, Bought it to replace a chest freezer. I like the space and ability to see what I have without having to dig. Its a bit loud but since its in the basement it doesn't bother me that much. Got it on sale, I'm happy with my purchase.
, Not a beautiful piece of furniture but it does the job. I am so happy to be able to stock up on frozen items, especially when they are on sale. This freezer holds a lot of food and makes it so easy to find; no more digging around in the cold for our...
, great freezer, plenty of storage areas and room and the price was a tremendous savings. similar freezers at Lowe's and Home Depot were $100-$150 higher.
, This freezer looks great! It looks like a small refrigerator but it has plenty of space inside. The frozen ice cream is just right, not too hard or too soft. We love it!
, Just the size freezer I wanted. Can see everthing at a glance. Don't have to go digging around in it to see what I want.
, Even though I have a larger refrigerator/freezer, I did not have enough freezer room to stock up. With the high cost of groceries, this 2nd dedicated freezer has helped to save $$. We've put it in the garage.
, I have had the freezer for about 1 month.  Worked great for the first 3 1/2 weeks.  I had gone on that Wednesday and had bought[$]in frozen food. We had the power flash on and off on Thursday.  Didn't notice it not working until my husband on Saturday ...
, Great for the extra freezer in the basement/garage.
, A very solid performer with a clean, attractive design.  Great size, it adds capacity without giving up as much floor space as other choices.  Good value for the $.
, Great Product Excellent
, Great freezer, just right for my family of 4. My only complaint was about how flimsy the door shelves bands are. I can see my children breaking one in the future when they are in a hurry to get something off the door. Otherwise its great!
, Useful for everyday freezing. Need larger capacity for holiday cooking.
, Very heavy, and takes some reasonable amount of space, but has a lot of inside space and adjustable shelves for all needs
, Great freezer buy. It is a little noisy but it is in my garage so the noise is not an issue. Great value.

, The freezer is a perfect size for us. We wanted to have a freezer in the garage for items that do not fit in the kitchen refrigerator/freezer. This fits the bill.
, A nice freezer asseembled right here in the good old USA imagine that. So appy I could buy from an American owned company
, I bought this freezer as a replacement for a chest freezer that was many years old. I love the defrost feature. I never see any build up of frost. Well lighted inside so there is no problem finding what your looking for. Door shelves are handy for item...
, Noisy and seems to run too much. Works OK, but I don't recommend it.
, As other reviewers have noted it can be loud at times. This is ok for me because the unit is in the garage. The temperature stays consistent.
, over all i love it a lot. it fits in the space very nicely and easy to get in and out of.
, This freezer is working out perfectly for us. There are just the two of us so we wanted something that we didn't have to bend in half to get into. Digging in a freezer is not an option at our age. We needed a lot of shelves for sorting but not too big ...
, Service man here 2 times in less than a month. replaced fan but didn't solve loud vibration.
, had to return the unit because it would not run. the unit looks good and has a lock.
, Serves it's purpose well but it is in our garage and we can still here the motor running in the main part of the house. Would recommend to a friend, but not for inside of house..
, We looked at about a dozen freezers befors settling on this one. Like the door handle.
, Stored in garage.  Very satisfactory.  Services very well for us -- two seniors.

, Bought 3, for wife and kids, use it with $15 a month pre paid, now they can text, inexpensive enough that when my kids lose it or break it, it can be replaced. BTW they are $10 more a Walmart
, everything is great about this phone except the settings. the settings are never clear. Sometimes when i txt my friends they never save but some tims they do. To download music you have to use the internet. internet isn't very great but that is fine...
, I read a couple of reviews about this phone before i bought it. Everyone claimed it was hard to program. I dont concider myself a genius about electronics, but this phone was easy to program and set up the way i wanted. This is a great simple phone
, It might be marketed as being 3G, but the only time it used 3G was when we visited the T-Mobile store. Highest volume setting was almost too quiet. The keyboard felt flimsy, and the keys were almost too soft and sensitive. We picked up the phone on a...
, So far frustrating to use and set up.will keep trying.
, Phone is slow, and had some audio problem with speakers had to take the first one back to the store for another.
, This is a good phone. I bought this phone as a back up phone 4 my prepay account. This phone is okay, not for every day use, but it could B better. For 39.99+Tax what more could u ask 4. Plus great customer service from Best Buy mobile. Thank U T...
, I have had TMobil prepaid phones since 2004. I needed to upgrade and always wanted a slider phone. The buttons are small but it works fine. Camera isn't bad for a low cost phone. The nice thing about this phone is it keeps a charge for a long time. I...
, This phone stop working the week after christmas. I would not recommend it to anyone.
, The phone is great.I bought it as a replacement phone and have had no issues with it. It was very easy to set it up the way I wanted it dont know why other's have had issues with this. Over all great simple phone for cheap.
, This is a good phone and works as a replacement for a regular tmobile contract. It could be a little more user friendly...
, Full qwerty and good functionality for a low cost pay as you go phone.
, I bought this direct through T-mobile. After few months, the phone was not working properly. I couldn't hear the other party unless I use speaker phone (hand-free)feature. I sent in for repair under warranty but I got it back without any repair ( I pai...
, The product is surprisingly counter intuitive; basically it is not easy to do normal phone things and it seems as though it is missing some important standard features. The operating buttons are truly too tiny to work comfortably and the set up is quit...
, The good: call quality is decent, picture is decent, sound quality is about average for your typical cellphone. THE BAD: Battery life only lasts about a day (on standby) breaks real easy; at work, my phone was on my desk (which is 3 feet high), and got...
, I purchased this for my daughter because she actually preferred a keyboard and not a touch screen since she primarily texts. I can give her service for a $1 a day and not feel like I'm getting taken for a ride! Overall it's serves it's purpose for keep...
, It is a great phone for a beginner who wants to type on the keyboard.
, Will not allow downloading of arbitrary Java apps. Has no free GPS navigation. Only navigation tools are commercial. Also web browser is EXTREMELY slow.

, The microwave is very good. It was a good buy for the money. The installation was easy> All components were in the box and the assembly was easy.
, The product is working well, but is still new. I am more interested in long term durability and I will be watching this. the product was easy to install and looks nice and I am pleased so far.
, Nice appearance. Extra steps to put in time with each use. Glass rotator is difficult to put back in place. Cooks well, is reasonable quiet. Would purchase an upgrade next time, still Whirlpool.
, I love my new whirlpool microwave. It is so simple to operate and looks great in my kitchen.
, would recommend this microwave to anyone. it's easy to use and works really well.
, It is easy to use, does what it says it can do and is beautiful with it's sleek design. It is every thing I had hoped for. The food is cooked, reheated perfectly.
, Its a very nice looking microwave. Price was FANTASTIC!
, Easy to use, love how spacious it is, and the quality. The only thing I would like for it to have, is the express minutes where all you do is hit the number 1 through 4 depending on how long you need instead of hitting the number plus 00 plus start.
, This is a great value compared to other over the oven Microwaves. The fan is a bit loud configured for recirculating, but in line with more expensive options.
, I like the design and the overall ease of use. would like a brighter light over the stove area, but it works well enough. Items takes less time to heat up than previous microwave. I like the way the door shuts alot better than with the old latch system...
, This microwave has a nice wide opening, and the height is about average. The rotating glass dish on the bottom makes for nice even warming. Has all the buttons and features one needs on a microwave.
, A great basic microwave. I wouldn't call it extensive. For the sale price, it was worth it. Regular price? I probably wouldn't have chosen it.
, Looked for an affordable microwave to replace an off-brand item. Install was easy and works well. Would recommend this item
, Our previous microwave (about 3 yrs old) suddenly stopped one day. It was a blessing in disguise as the Whirlpool model we ended up with is much, much better. From the door shutting without a loud 'whap' to the quiet operation to the over the range lig...
, So far, the appliance has operated as advertised and appears to made of quality materials.
, This microwave has all one can expect The vent is very efficient compared to my former GE microwave. It cooks / warms up very well. The only thing I don't like: the timer function only rings ONCE at the end. So if you don't hear it, too bad for you! I ...
, I took my time with installation as I was replacing a 16 year old Whirlpool Microwave.  I had to take time as the templates are designed to mount to the bottom of the overhead cabinet.  I couldn't get it to stay in place.  I ended up measuring every ho...
, When we purchased a new home, this microwave was already installed, so we didn't have a choice of appliances. In general I have been happy with this microwave, with the exception of the vent fan. The vent fan is quite loud and automatically turns itsel...
, This product is very user friendly and has so far been very easy to keep clean. It is very quiet when functioning.
, I love this microwave looks great over my stove. very user friendly and has all the features I was looking for.
, Sleek and stylish with so many features, this great microwave is a huge leap from my big, clunky first microwave that took up half my counter space (and I was thrilled to have it). I love the cook power feature, the spacious interior and its modern ext...
, We bought this microwave along with other matching pieces. We are very pleased with it so far. We recommend it.
, We switched from a countertop microwave to this over the range style when we recently remodeled. I'm not liking it as much as my old unit. The sensor cooking and defrosting features work well. It is very noisy in comparison to previous microwaves we've...
, I don't use my microwave all that much. I basically wanted something to fill the hole of the filthy, broken one I was replacing. The two-way light works great for a night light, when I know I'll be arriving home after dark. It looks just right over my ...
, I love the ease of use in this product with a few exception. The keypad is too dark and is difficult to read and more light is needed under the hood.
, My vent is venting into the house. I have a vent to the outside of the house and the air is pushing up through the top of the microwave.
, Very happy with this microwave. It was easy to install. The price was much cheaper compared to others. Powerful fan and heats food fast and evenly.
, I would buy another one when this gets old.Love it
, Love the design. Simple and easy to use. Meets all my expectations.
, My wife and I are very pleased with this microwave. For the money its a great purchase.
, We put this in a rental unit that underwent substantial remodeling. The appearance of this appiance helped us rent the house immediately!
, We have had this microwave for only two months but it works great and haven't had any problems.
, Has all features that we needed and a few we wanted but didn't need. The look is very nice. Looks great in our kitchen
, I had the microwave installed by Lowes and they were great about it. The micro looks great and works very well.

, Need a replacement for our old white microwave and this one was perfect. Easy to install and get going.
, I bought this microwave to replace the frigidaire model that worked fine but all the plastic trim pieces continue to break and would cost more to replace the pieces than a whole new microwave. So far, we love it and have no issues whatsoever with it.

, We thoroughly enjoy all of our Whirlpool products. Our stove, microwave and dishwasher are great!!!

, The key pad is easy to understand. It heats faster than my previous microwave.

, Its a good product and its very easy to use even for my kids
, This style is quite new for us as we usually had a counter top. We took our current cabinet & created the perfect space by removing bottom shelf, it was a lot of work but well worth it & it looks fantstic over our stovetop. Just love the clean lines.

, Mine came with a visible dent, but Cust Svc finally helped with that. Love the microwave. Looks really good and works like a charm. It actually works in almost half the time of our old microwave. Love it!!

, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE MOUNT IS NOT AS STURDY AS I THINK IT SHOULD BE. IT APPEARS THAT THE TOP WHERE IT IS MOUNTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CABINET, IS NOT SOLID ENOUGH AND LETS IT WIGGLE. HAVE NOT HAD AN PROBLEM BUT I DO NOTICE THE SLACK THERE.

, This product is easy to you. Other microwaves I had used before were a little more complicated and took a few miniutes to know how to work, but this product I could work instantly. Also, I like the features. For example, the Add 30 sec button. I can ad...

, The microwave works perfect except the vent really isn't strong enough to pull back the vapors when cooking on the front burners of the stove. Other than that it is a great microwave.
, My only real complaint is that it mounts with 2 bolts and the back bracket, but the structure is not solid enough to bolt it up tight. It just deforms and pulls at the mounting points and does not suck up tight to create a uniform gag to the cabinet ov...

, This is part of our dream kitchen package in our new mobile home. I am amazed at what top pieces were used in this package.
, We bought this microwave to reoplace an older, aging one. It really performs well and has great features. As noted in the above rating, the noise level is a little bit loud. It is not so loud to be concerned about, but it is there.
, It's only got 1000W, so it's a step down from the 1400W unit we used to have. it's got some nice features, but the instruction manual (if you could call it that) leaves a lot to be desired. None of the various buttons are described in any detail, and...
, This microwave / hood combination is not only good looking but has the features which I wanted. It is easy to use and performs well. I can't think of anything that I would change.

, I got it for my rental house. The tenants like it very much. I'm happy I made the right decision
, Purchased this unit in February 2013, found it easy to install and easy to learn to operate, love my new microwave!
, The plentiful codes for reheating/cooking items is very helpfully placed inside the door frame so as not to clutter up the display. I wish it had LED lighting and a green display (instead of blue) or color changeable display to match the rest of my app...
, Bought this microwave to replace one from the old days. After reviewing all models and brands, we again went to Whirlpool for its convenience, size, and price for the quality. It is quiet and very stylish in Stainless steel. We are very pleased with it!
, The washing machine gets our cloths much cleaner with less water and less soap usage. Also, we have notices much less dryer lint, which in-turn means that the washer is not causing as much wear on the cloths. The dryer is great!! It is much quieter tak...
, This unit replaces the Whirlpool microwave that I've had for the past 12 years with no problems at all. The only reasons that I'm replacing it is becasue the clips holding the vent cover broke and it had a large crack in the dooor.
, Prior to looking for a new microwave I talked to several people in the repair business. Whirlpool always came in first for being recommended as a product with the fewest problems and the best longevity as compared to their competitors. If you want one ...
, this micro wave is the best value out there... It is easy to install, nice looking and the features are easy to use!!
, I love my new stainless steel Whirlpool microwave. It is very easy to sleek and shiny looking in comparison to my old black one. It is very easy to use and the power features are great. It takes much less time for my food to cook or warm up and therefo...
, This is a terrific microwave. Food cooks as programmed. The best feature is that the fan comes on automatically if the microwave detects smoke---this feature has saved a fire on my stove. In 15+ years I have only had two microaves and both have been Wh...
, We are very happy with our new Whirlpool Microwave.
, we already owned one in the kitchen above the stove, we remodeled the downstairs and added a kitchen and we loved the one upstairs that we had to have another Whirlpool microwave downstairs.
, I like everything about this microwave. It's easy to use and a great price.I looked at many microwaves before I got this one. I read every review on many. This one had the best review by far.I think Whirlpool has the best products on the market. Every ...
, I think this product fits the bill. I like this product.
, I love this microwave. It's true to the time settings. I don't have to nuke my food 5 times just to get it warm. The automatic fan scared me at first but its a great feature to have. Overall 2 thumbs up.
, I bought this microwave ~6 months ago, and so far I have been very pleased. No complaints from any members of the household.
, I like it a lot. It mounted easily and looks nice and sleek in black. I replaced it with an old Whirlpool, which lasted eleven years. I don't like the defrost option as it is confusing. Whirlpool still needs to figure out better options for defrost. So...
, This is overall a good product for the price It's got sufficient volume and power. The controls are manageable and seems to perform well. The white finish is a little static clingy (attracts dust), but that might wear off. Definately worth the money. T...
, This microwave is very powerful, defrosts frozen meat quickly. Cooks foods quickly and evenly. Great product for the price.
, I would highly recommend Whirlpool for any of your next appliance purchase. Our family chose to have the microwave mounted above our stove. In doing so, we have additional counter space.
, I've had this microwave for about 6 months now with no problems. It looks and works great. The price was reasonable especially for a stainless steel model.
, This unit is a stylist microwave with incredible value for the price. Runs quiet, easy to clean, and looks sharp.
, My first having a microwave over stove top burners and I find it to be a usefull spot. My Whirpool microwave has been an excellent product.
, Do your homework best bang for buck! Love the fact that it has a recirculating fan that is filtered and doesn't need to be vented.
, We have only used product a few times, as this was purchased at a second home. This will become our permanent resident this spring, so I am sure we will get many uses from this product along with your other products.
, After 3 months of use we really enjoy our new microwave. Well worth the investment.
, Overall, this was a great product. Very happy with it. Being that it is new to us, we are still trying to figure it out.
, My only complaint is that once the fan starts automatically you can not turn it off. It so to noisy at that time.
, We have had this microwave over our stove in our new house for three months now and it works great. The reheat features are fantastic. The only problem I have had is the bulb in the light has already burned out twice. I am not sure if it was the type o...
, I like the 30 sec button, but don't like that the fan comes on every time you use the microwave as it is a noisy.
, This is a great appliance, quiet and easy to clean. I would recommend it. The directions could be a bit simpler to follow.
, I love this product. It is easy to use. Heats up fast and big inside for larger items. Definitely recommend it.
, This microwave is absolutely perfect. It has features you actually use, looks beautiful, is easy to clean, and is simple to use right from the start. We couldn't believe you could get such quality for a wonderful price. The fan is quiet and really pull...
, This microwave has a ton of space and is easy to use. We have used it for everything from defrosting to full scale cooking. Only complaint is that the table does not turn smoothly, it jerks back and forth and sometimes sloshes liquids around in the con...
, The product has all the things that I was looking for in a microwave plus the price was great.
, The reference guide is located on the microwave when you open the unit. Never have to pull out the manual again!
, This microwave defrosts meats and other foods much more effectively than any one I have used in the past. Food is defrosted without being partially cooked in the process. You can follow most packaged food instructions without deviation and foods turns ...
, I like the fact that when the stove below gets too hot with steam, etc. the fan on the microwave automatically turns on to cool it down. I like the way it looks, very modern
, Purchased to replace one that had quit heating. Took less than 15 minutes to remove old unit and mount new one. The design is fabulous. Looks great, works well, and is easy to use. Many features not found on cheaper models. Especially like the 30 secon...
, This microwave doesn't have some of the bells and whistles that the more expensive microwaves do (no convection). However, I am not a believer of making meals in the microwave - our family uses more for popcorn, re-heating so it wasn't necessary to spe...
, has good features and all the things we use every day
, Replaced a counter top model with this hood model. Cooks much better and is very easy to use. Had a problem with the interior light flickering after installing it. Called for repair and had someone here the next day. Had replacemnet bulb shipped, no pr...
, Love the new microwave and new features it has! Great!
, I am very pleased with this product with one exception. It does not have a pause feature, so you can stir your food and then it will continue.
, Unit works very well. Easy to use, large interior cooking area. One complaint I would have would be the exhaust fan. It moves the smoke/ air from over the stove directly into the upper cabinets, would be better if it vented outside in my opinion.
, Sleek look. Easy to use. However, if you have dinner size, square plates (11 across), they won't be able to rotate on carousel. No biggie, though. Great look and performance for the price.
, we had our previous microwave for 12 years and we thought it would be difficult to get use to a new one. Not with the Whrilpool. It has been great with the 2 speed fan and 2 stage light. Cook times are terrific and so easy to put into the machine. We w...
, Nice style microwave in stainless steel, easy to install fan is noise.
, We're delighted with our new Whirlpool 1.7 cu ft microwave. In addition to all the power we need, the two-level light and two-speed fan are important features we use all the time. The door opens gently and closes softly but firmly. It's quiet. But I mo...
, Good convenient features.. not too noisy.. powerful and perfect ... Simple but beautiful design
, We've had this for about 4 months now and it does an excellent job for everything we need it to do. We didn't need a very advanced microwave since we primarily use it to warm up left-overs. We also use the fan as our over-the-range vent and it seems to...
, I bought this as a replacement for a unit that was a little aged, and what a BIG difference the years have made!! This model is much more powerful, easier to use, and has many more features than the old one did!! I would recommend this microwave to eve...
, whirlpool products have given my wife & i 10 years plus of great service. when our microwave needed replacement it was not a hard decision to replace with same manufacturer.
, After looking at several brands, I chose this one because of its overall appearance, features, as well as price. I have used my microwave almost three months and have not been disappointed.
, It was simply hands down what we thought to be a best buy
, I actually received this as a Christmas gift. It looks great, was easy to install and I have not had any problems with it. I doubt that I would have chosen this particular model for myself, but since it was a gift, I kept it out of respect for the give...
, I love this item cause it has the 30section button
, We are pleased with our microwave purchase. The over the stove size and mount ability worked well in our kitchen. The features are very convenient. Especially the 30 second reheat. The interior and the exterior of the unit is very easy to clean. We wou...
, It was pretty easy for our folks to assemble into wall.
, This microwave does all we ask of it, and it was a very good bargain.
, We've had this for two months and are very pleased with it. It took a little over 20 minutes to install and works perfectly. The features are comparable to what was on our GE Profile microwave and at a great price. This unit is actually quieter than ou...
, It is a good product overall with many features. However, I find having to open the door and look at the instructions printed on the inside to use the special features (defrosting, warming, etc.) a little confusing. Other microwaves that have prompts b...
, I decided to go with a basic microwave because I rarely used any special features on ones I've had in the past. This one was very easy to install and is very easy to use. I like the blue digits. The vent fan does not seem to have enough draw.
, This replaced a Kenmore 1000 watt which I'll compare this with. Likes: 1) This seems more powerful even though same wattage. 2) Like the sunken turntable= more space. 3) Fan is quieter and blows up rather than at you. 4) Whirlpool product, I like them;...
, Was easily installed and functions well. The exhaust fan will activate automatically when the stove and oven produce too much heat. It can't be turned off manually. It seems a little sensitive, but may be necessary to preserve the unit.
, We purchased this item since our old one (different brand) finally gave out. I am amazed at how quiet it is...the old one was extremely annoying and we could never talk while it was running. The stove light is properly located to shine on your range. T...
, I have had no problems with this microwave. It works great, easy to clean and is not loud. Fan works great and light as well. I have had it for 3 months now and fulfills all my needs for a microwave.
, Love this microwave! We got it with our new kitchen remodel and we are thrilled. It cooks food well, is easy to use (I especially love the add 30 seconds button!), and it looks stylish, too! Would definitely recommend it to anyone. :)

, i really love my new microwave. It is easy to operate and heats/cooks the food really well. I would recommend it to any one who asks about new purchasing one.

, Microwave looks good, and is easy to use. It is also very efficient.
, I've had the unit about three months now and it has performed flawlessly. One thing I found odd was that the height of the unit was close to two inches taller. That puts it closer to the range top so be careful of that.
, I thoroughly enjoy my new microwave oven. I bought this one to replace a very old model when we remodeled our kitchen. It heats things so much faster, very easy to operate and clean, and is an attractive addition to my new kitchen. Love the turntable -...
, simple & easy to use--bought this for my mother & father in-law, wanted something that would be easy for them to program, they love it so that makes me love it.
, I replace my 12yr old Whirlpool microwave and choose the same brand because the reliability and quality of the products Whirlpool has, i really like my new oven, for the price i pay has an overall excellent performance.
, Just got the microwave a few months ago. The design is pretty and easy to clean. The features are easy to use! So far its been great!
, I found the product to very useable and am looking forward to many years of dependable service. I have 2 suggestions however; 1) There is no comprehensive user manual. What came with the devise was mostly an installation guide which was most useful roe...
, We bought this microwave along with our other Whirlpool appliances. We were replacing our old ones that were 15 years old. We purchased this product in Jan 2013 so far we have had no problems. It is quiet and open and closes with ease, unlike my last o...

, the appliances we purchased were the best bang for are buck, we have always been very happy with whirlpool products and there are very dependable Shawn and Les
, The microwave fulfills all of our microwave needs. We use it for defrosting, cooking and reheating. The non cooking features i.e. the stove exhaust and lights work well. It has a good beeper without being too annoying like some microwaves I have had.
, We bought this microwave to match our stove and based most of our decision on price. We have had it for a few months and have no complaints. It is easy to use and looks great. It is a little loud when in use, but definitely not a deal breaker.
, This is a wonderful product and I am so happy I have it!! So many easy functions, also! Looks great in my kitchen and saves me so much counter space. Cannot say enough good about this microwave!! Great design...
, This microwave is super easy to use, looks stylish, and works great!
, I bought this to replace my old kenmore. It heats quick and is quite. It also has features that are very useful.
, Overall a very nice microwave, stainless steel finish is very good. The cooking power is good. I also like the hidden exhaust vents, powerful 2 speed fan does the job. It does everything I would expect it to do and looks good doing it. The only thing I...
, Excellent value for the money. The only complaint that i have is the color of the display does not match the color of the display on the whirlpool range that i have. Other than that, it is great!
, We bought this unit to replace a 5 yr old unit that had a cracked door. We now know that the fan MUST be used while boiling anything on the stove top. The new unit has been in since Christmas and it doing great! Its easy to use and program.
, This microwave is simple to operate, has a lot of room for larger items, and heats food quickly. I'm happy I picked it!
, The microwave is very easy to use and clean up is so easy. The color matched my other Whirlpool products perfectly even though they were much older. I would recommend this product to anyone in need of a new microwave. The price is very reasonable.
, We got this to replace a 2 year old Frigidaire gallery microwave (which i would NOT recommend) The price was great, performance is good, its what you would expect for the price. The light on the display is a nice bright blue color. For some reason the ...
, the price was good and I needed one at the moment,
, We bought this microwave to match our other appliances that are stainless steel and black. We love how it matches and it works great. It is easy to operate and the children have no problem using it to heat up left overs!
, I purchased this unit from a website. Sight unseen. I usually like to touch and feel first, but I went with my gut instinct expecting to be disappointed. This unit is well constructed, easy to install & more than I ever expected. Well worth more than I...

I would never have purchased this washer had I known what I know now about the washer. Can't adjust water level to cover clothing either.
, I was miserable with my front loader (not a Samsung) which would not stay balanced on our uneven basement floor. This Samsung is faster, quieter, and does a better job--and stays balanced--no vibrating out of position. I love the sleek look and grey...
, Love the load capacity of this washer. No more trips to the laundry mat for bulky items. Doesn't clean some items as well as I would like.
, MAN THIS WASHER GETS MY CLOTHES SOOOO CLEAN AND WE HAVE WELL WATER... MY WHITES HAVE NEVER BEEN WHITER!!!

, This, like all other HE washers use very little water. They are designed to do just this. You DO NOT want to have a bunch of water in the machine. When extra water is added, it dilutes your detergent, it does not get the clothes cleaner. Let these...
, Have my Samsung top loader 2 days now.....a little disappointed in the water levels....I still don't understand why these manufacturers won't let the consumer decide how much water they want to use. We pay for our water not them...The normal cycle...
, Handles large loads with only occasional need for redistribution of contents (most likely the contents being washed and not the washer though). Clothes have been very clean. Very effective spin cycle - clothes are minimially damp when finished.
, I love this washer!! I was pleasantly surprised when my washer came with a stainless steel wrap. Very pretty. I am now able to wash large items that would not fit in my old washer. The wash action is gentle on clothes. Excellent cleaning. Just be sure...
, I love this washer. My king size comforter is small in this tub. I do wish it had an automatic detergent dispenser that you fill once and it uses the liquid as needed. It is also quite a reach to get the last sock out of the bottom, and I am nearly 6...
, Pros: Huge capacity. Beautiful design. Quiet operation. Cons: Wasn't free.
, I purchased this machine about 3mo. ago. I cannot say enough good about it. My clothes are so much cleaner. They smell so good after. No problems operating it. The only thing I do find if you load the machine like it has an agator in it it cleans the...
, Very, very disappointed in this washer. I've only had it for four months and now the spin cycle is not working. I only had a set of king sheets and a couple of towels in it and it's now broken. Still under warranty and customer service is good.
, My husband is a farmer and I have two kids. Therefore, I wash a LOT of filthy clothes. This washer is AWESOME and has the load capacity of a front end loader.
, Have only had this machine for two days now and so far my wife and I really like what we have seen and experience so far. Large 4.7 tub really makes washing big items a breeze. Was worried about how clean clothes would come out and so far so good but...

, Got this washer this am and have washed and dried three loads and it is great so far!!
, I have had this washer for about 2 months and love it. First top load, old washer was a front load. Clothes seem to be cleaner after washed, maybe thats the power foam technology, alot quieter than my old front load, has not gone off balance yet, and...
, When the washer is draining, the water pump makes a lot of noise. When signal is selected, this washer plays a tune (for several seconds) rather than making a buzz or beep sound. This tune gets very annoying after a day or two. There is no way to...
, I like this new Samsung top-load washer. Our old washer, a Maytag Neptune TL, was amazing at getting clothes clean. Even the most stubborn, set in stains came out, (with the aid of oxiclean powder). The only thing I did not like about our old washer is...
, Every time I wash my clothes, the water level is always different. There will be times there is enough water that covers all my clothes and then there are times the water doesn't cover all my clothes. The times when it doesn't have enough water, the...
, This may be the worst washer we've ever owned. We purchased this one to do large items, like horse blankets, saddle blankets, towels, jeans, coveralls, etc. The previous 2 washers we had accomplished this task, but this washer does a terrible job of...
, super quiet,super fast the machine is a Beast! Whats not to like.
, I replaced a much loved HE front loader with this washing machine. I like it - it looks nice, is able to wash huge amounts of clothing, and the quick wash is just over 30 minutes. If I hadn't had my past front loader I'd love this machine, but in...
, Still getting to know this machine, but so far we are very impressed with it. so much better than the front loader it replaced.
, I have now been using my washer / dryer set for a month and have had no problems and love them!
, I went back a forth trying to decide if I should get another front load or the top load I settled on the top load. Purchased my Samsung top load from Lowe's (at a great price) and I couldn't be happier. I will never have another front load again. BTW...
, So far so good, first time I had a new washer and the first time I have ever had to read an instruction booklet to know how to operate a washer.
, After 4 years of fighting with a Maytag Bravo (which was only 4 years old) I replaced it with this Samsung, SO GLAD I did!!! This machine is awesome! Can not believe the differance in cleaning. The power foam does an excellent job of cleaning. I am...
, I've really enjoyed my new powerfoam top load washer. the inside is huge! so you can wash more at a time so it cuts down your loads of laundry. very happy that we purchased this washer.
, I got this washer 3 months ago when my 16 year old washer died. I love it! I have 4 kids and do a lot of laundry. I've been able to wash everything on cold and it comes out clean. I've done comforters, beach towels, kids coats and other bulky items...
, After years of purchasing basic to medium scale washers I decided that it was time to upgrade to a high preformance washer. I absolutely love this machine. After you set your cycle, levels, temp, etc. then the rest is up to the machine. I have observed...
, We purchased this Samsung washer, and have run 12 loads through the machine so far. The machine does a great job washing and rinsing the clothes, and spins them at near supersonic speeds. We have washed whites, towels, jeans, and even a load with three...
, It's a great size, efficient, cleans well and I love the singing it does when it's done!

, after a bit of research on various websites, I decided to purchase the SamsungWA5471. This is a replacement for a 10 year old Fisher-Paykel eco top loader. It was delivered late yesterday and I'm on my third load. So far, an excellent machine: I am...
, I shopped around different stores and found this Samsung to be the best bang for the buck. We've been using it for two weeks and my wife is spending much less time at the washing machine. It's so quiet I find myself checking to see if it's still...
, We switched to a front load washer about 3 years ago. Needless to say we are now in the market for a new washer already. A year and three months after buying the front loader, the front gasket ripped for no apparent reason. Of course I did not purchase...
, We were tired of our Bosch front loader continuing to have mildew issues on the rubber gasket, and we're leery of having similar issues with another front loader brand. The top loader has the old look, but with no annoying agitator to destroy your...
, I have had this washer for about a month - and the matching dryer. I was hesitant to buy a washer without an agitator, all seems well. The washer is quiet, features easy to use, and rarely goes out of balance. My only issue is that for some loads there...
, Very quiet, loaded with features and you hardly know it is operating. Wish we had a little more control over the wash and rinse temperatures. They are predetermined.
, Unless you iron everything including bedding and towels, do not buy this. I have tried every cycle, all settings, different volume of clothing - in order to find a way to wash my clothes and not have them come out twisted in tight coils and knotted...
, When installing the WA5471 washer the directions are very specific that the unit needs to be leveled, but only the front 2 feet are adjustable. Calling the Samsung help line confirmed the need and the lack of adjustment. Do not buy this model if your...
, Great product. Saves me money on my house bills. With the features clothes come out dry from the washer. I only have to run dryer for 20 mins.
, Washer never fills to a water level that is appropriate for the load. You either have to run the clothes or bedding through a rinse cycle first or add water with a bucket once the wash starts. The water level/weight sensor does not work on the machine....
, Samsung washer Model #WA5471 is extremely quiet with large enough capacity to make the laundry task easy.
, Love the look of this machine and the many choices I can make to customize my wash load. It has a much bigger capacity than my last washer.
, I purchased this machine to replace a Whirlpool Duet front-loader. I purchased a front-loader when they were fairly new technology, 10 years ago, because I wanted to save water and energy. I have had two since then, including the Whirlpool, and will...
, In the past we have always purchased low end washers. Heavy duty, high capacity, and very few cycles. My wife was impressed with the capacity of this machine and no agitator. We did a couple of weeks of research and comparison shopping and purchased...
, After a flood throughout our downstairs due to the failure of our 11 year old machine. We researched countless washers and finally decided to purchase this Smasung. The main reason was the size of the drum. At 4.7 Cu. Ft. it is the largest we could...

, I've been using this machine for couple weeks now and I live with other people. We are all complaining that the machine doesn't wash. I put my clothes in and select normal cycle. The water mixes with the detergent, but the water level doesn't cover...
, I did a lot of research on the top load washers looked at all the models and brands. I was real hesitant about all of them. My wife was getting sick of going to the Laundry mat after our 20 year old washer stopped working so we decided to get the...
, I finally have a HE clothes washer that works! My new SAMSUNG WA5471 washer is quiet, cleans, but doesn't destroy the clothes, and is easy to operate. It's practically impossible to get an out of balance message with this washer. The clothes come out...
, I really like my new washer - it's huge (I can easily wash in 1 load what used to be 2-3 loads), is VERY gentle on clothes and cleans well. BUT I do have one issue - I don't really think the PowerFoam works. I've figured out it's one of 3 things:...
, I purchased the washer and dryer set one month ago. I love them! When purchasing at Lowe's, you don't get the true experience until they are delivered to your home and plugged in. They light up like the dash board of a car! This machine has all the...

, This samsung washing machine is the worst machine ever. It will not get all of the clothes wet and then even thou it has a warranty they will still charge you a service fee. the water senors are very bad in this machine and I would not recommend this...
, We were skeptical to purchase appliances from Samsung (they make TV and phones, right??) until we started doing the research. We purchased a Samsung refrigerator a few years ago and could not be happier. That said, when we needed a new top loading...

, We have had the washer for two weeks and we love it. It is everything they say it is and more. Great washer!
, Features and design of the washer are great. We could not get the foam to work and clothes on top would not get washed. Tech support looked at it and said I needed a new washer. Luckily the store I purchased it from let me get the front loader at the...
, Have to wash everything on Heavy Duty and NOTHING comes clean. The bleach and softner dispensers seem to be off timing. I wish we had our 25 year old machine back. It's hard to believe this saves energy, since it takes about 1 hour and ten minutes. It...
, We recently had to replace our dryer and decided to purchase a washer and dryer. The Samsung is fun to watch, and the design is modern and fits well in small laundry room. Of more substance, however, is the functionality of the two units. The washer is...

, One of the best user friendly cameras on the market loaded with the most commonly used features rather than a plethora of programs that most people will never use.
, Easy to carry around. Images are fast to download to computer. The battery has been great (aka lasts long) so far.
, once again panasonic didn't disappoint me.
, We use this camera to capture birds that visit our back yard and other fleeting experiences in lift that cry out for a more permanent record. It is great!
, A 14 megapixel camera with Leica optics at this price point is a pretty darned good deal! The lens is a little slow, so it's not the greatest for really low light.
, This is a nice compact camera. Takes great pictures. You will need a tripod to get quality pics when you are zooming in to get those close-up shots, but the camera has the mounting hole for that tripod shoe.
, This replaces a 5.6M Panasonic Lumix. The old one was more durable and lasted 5 trips to Alaska, but died in Venezuela. Batteries last long, easy focus, great images. The digital zoom only matches the 10X zoom of the smaller format unit.
, I moved up from the 10x model and have been very pleased with the performance of this camera. Image quality is sharp as a tack and responds very quickly. I am finding myself liking this camera better than my full size digital SLR. I would recommend...
, The price and the product are great.
, Christmas 2007 I was given the older version of this camera (10 megapixel, 10x Optical zoom) because my wife thought it would be simple enough for me to use, and it was! I love this little camera. It was one of the first digital cameras in this price...
, This is a great camera with a long zoom in a small package. It's size makes it easy to carry with you without adding extra weight or bulk. There are many custom settings and features from which to choose or just set it to auto. Any setting will get...
, I would have give 5 stars if it had a high resolution LCD display. LCD display on this model is horrible. Lousy user interface. Other than these silly concerns, if you are looking for a camera with high picture quality look nowhere, grab this camera at...
, This is by far the best point and shoot camera out there. I have been upgrading for the last 5 years with each new lumix model and have never been disappointed. It's so gratifying to have someone ask where I bought the 30x40 framed print hanging on...
, Love the 16x zoom. It's pretty easy to use, and a good size. Smaller would be better, but it packs a lot in a relatively small body. I lost this camera, and replaced it with exactly the same one. Nothing out there in this price range that I like better.
, My husband is a novice when it comes to taking pictures and he found this camera to be easy to use and understand all its features.
, I had to upgrade from my cannon camera since I am working as a flight attendant and seen the world and capturing the experiences needed a little extra quality. I found this camera at an amazing price on sale for 139 which is 50% off.The quality is...
, Bought this for my girlfriend, and she totally loved it. Amazing optical zoom and picture quality. Great quality for the price!!!
, I bought this camera for a digital photography class in college, and so far I am really impressed that it can handle everything the larger digital cams can, but packed in such a small size. I found it really easy and intuitive to learn to use and the...
, Great product, great pictures, easy to use. It offers several programs, from'point-to-shoot' till'you-set-everything'. The rechargeable battery lasts long, even when making HD videos. I strongly recommend this camera.
, I love this camera. I have always had trouble with focus and placement of the main item in the picture, but with this camera all I had to do was point and shoot. For the first time in my life, I've taken some really good pictures. The telescope lens...
, This is a great little camera for those who want nice pictures without spending a fortune. Also, I love that it's small and will easily stow in my purse.
, I had bought nikon s9100 and returned because like so many other people camera didn't want to focus on alt of shoots. When it did the pictures where really good. But to many shots wouldn't focus. So i bought the panasonic zs-8 and took pictures with...
, Panasonic Lumix is a quality automatic camera with great zoom features. I purchased this camera as a backup for my Nikon D40 due to its compact size. The compact sized camera contains 14mp picture quality with video recording capability. I paid under...
, This camera is exactly what I was looking for: light and compact, loaded with great features, big view screen, plenty of optical zoom, and all at a pretty decent price. Only possible downside is picture quality not quite as crisp as I'm used to, but...
, This is a great camera, so sleek and sharp. The picture quality is great also. I haven't played around with it too much to test all the features, but so far I love it. It is a small camera, though, so if you have large hands you may want to go handle...
, I have a tremor in my hands and have always had trouble finding a camera with a good steady shot, this camera has best steady shot of the multiple point and shoot cameras I have owned. Night shots are amazing, I have never been able to take such clear...
, I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She wanted something that had some SLR like features, and I didn't want to pay a bunch of money. After doing some research I decided to go with the Panasonic Lumix, it had everything my daughter was...
, I have had a Gateway, Kodak, and Nikon Point and shoot Digital Camera. The Panasonic ZS8 is by far better than all of the others combined. It is easy to use, don't get many blured shots. It is small in size.,
, Used first time at Outdoors and came out with flying colors, Easy to use and very responsive.
, This is an excellent camera for getting closeups without spending an arm and a leg for more elaborate cameras costing twice as much or more.Easy to use and produces excellent pictures.Has the same problem most cameras in this price range or less - NO...
, This camera allowed me to take close up pictures from a few inches away, for example, flowers. It was also a great camera for taking pictures of spectacular sites with clarity and sharpness, for example, the Taj Mahal, and mountain waterfalls. The...
, I bought this for my wife to take on our recent trip.She has shaky hands due to essential tremor and this camera was rrated by DP review to have the best stabilization. It worked very well for her.It is not going give National Geographic pictures but...
, Product was what I ordered and seems to be fully functional.
, It's one of the best cameras I have ever purchased. It has all manual controls, in addition to the iAuto mode and Scene modes if you don't want to bother yourself. It also takes 720p Videos. The only thing I don't like is that it takes a long time...
, NIce camera, great pics, no card included in sale.
, This camera is good but not for a beginner. The menu is difficult to navigate and the camera is kind of clunky. I returned this camera because I had to play with too many of the menu options to get the picture quality to be clear and not washed out. Th...
, Bought this to take pictures for work and love everything about it, purchased for $100 off on one day sale, even better!
, Great camera for someone that wants to take good pictures and not take a course in photography.
, Amazing camera! The zoom on this is very impressive. The picture quality is also amazing. I go to a lot of sporting events and this camera is perfect for capturing sports moments. The video quality is equally impressive as it captures video at 720p. Ju...
, I had a Panasonic Lumix camera for years and it gave the best quality photos I could ever ask for. I used it so much I literally wore out the button you press to take a picture. I recently replaced it with this Panasonic camera and I couldn't be happi...
, I wanted a camera to use when I don't neet to get out my SLR's that was easy to use and take great pictures. I got my wife another Lumix, and I use it on a trip to Bryce Canyon and got some great pictures. This one has a large zoom and more MP.
, I bought this for a trip to NYC. I wanted quality pictures to capture moments from my dream trip. The camera did just that.
, I had a earlier almost same camera and Associate showed me this one and was what i wanted when shown!! Almost same Camera but newer version.
, Great value for 14 mp ,zoom & image stabilizaertion.
, My second Lumix, this one was an upgrade on mp and zoom. Gave other one to my son. Easy to use, sharp pictures, good for video, too. Like the size, no need for bulky camera big or a big tote when on vacation or concerts. Would readily recommend it!
, Great camera! Easy to use Great quality pictures Includes a software, not so easy to use, but I doesn't matter It's a good deal for price.
, I First was thinking of a DSLR then after some serious reading realized that a person will not ever really see anything more then 12mp. The more MP is for the sales to keep going. Along with the fact I hate carrying my wallet, let alone a HUGE Case for...
, I've owned many point and shoot cameras made by many of the popular manufacturers. By far, the Panasonic Lumix Z8 is at a level with the best and a level above most. I use my point and shoot as a back up to my DSLR, which is why it is important to hav...
, I love this camera. I purchased this camera after my son broke my last Lumix. Wow.. I am sure glad he did. I liked my old Lumix but this one has upgraded features and much easier to use. I mentioned the battery. Although not able to use a standard batt...

, I spoke with a lot of people who are camera experts! They were very surprised to find so many great features on this camera for the price. They told me the lens quality was outstanding. With very little set up, this camera does it all. I have set it to...
, This is an extremely easy to use camera. I have used on vacations and to film my children at sporting events. It makes really nice 720pHD movies. The optical zoom gets a bit difficult to hold steady at high levels of zoom but this is pretty common with...
, I had high hopes for this camera, but I ended up going with the Canon SX260 HS, which is more expensive but you do get what you pay for. The ZS8 is not a bad product, in fact, it's very impressive what it can do given what it costs. It has a killer zo...
, I don't know much about cameras, so let's start there. I wanted a fairly inexpensive camera that would take moderately good photographs. I tried a different brand, and the pictures looked awful. I returned it and came across this open box item. I fel...
, I've had it for a few weeks now and have grown to like it a lot. It works well in my hands. The shutter lag is so much better than my old Sony H5 that it is funny. The picture quality is as good as I would expect with all that zoom. I could take it ba...
, I've only had the camera for about a month and am still trying to make the time to learn how to take advantage of its many features and capabilities. I like how compact it is. Also that I no longer have to deal with a loose lens cover.
, This camera, for it's price is really excellent - one of the great surprises was the great video it takes with no sound distortion at all.
, I took to an Okland A's game and my pictures were wonderful. I am going tomorrow night to another game. I took it on vacation and the pictures are so good I my never take my DSLR again.
, I uses this camera for work to check for defects at the tops of utility poles. The zoom and picture quality is incredible. I know in this day of great smart phone cameras, a box camera is not as useful, but this is a must if you need a good zoom.
, I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He love it! I have an older version that I paid 3 times as much for, so this is a great deal!
, I have been so impressed with this camera that I have purchased the updated model, plus bought one for each of my daughters! The photos are great, always clear and the color is beautiful. I always get compliments on the pictures I share. My only compla...
, Great upgrade from my TZ3 Panasonic Lumix. This ZS8 tells me how to set it up. Very nice. It even takes closer close-ups!
, This is a great camera. I was watching it for a price drop and it came up as a deal of the day. With the 16X Optical zoom you will not be disappointed. It is small enough to go in a pocket for easy carrying around. The one thing that I really like is t...
, The Camera is good with Lots of features . Good Photos. It would be great it touch screen was introduced. The camera is a bit bulky with the Switches a bit primitive
, Although there are 16 MP with comparable prices, after a careful review and research, I chose this camera for its well rounded overall quality. Study all its available options, and you shall found rewarding qualities you are looking for.
, Would like to purchase another at that great price of around $119.00 like I got the first one purchased.
, I really like this camera. It takes good pictures I got the camera for only $102 because the only one the store had in stock was the demo.

, What a great camera. Love the large 3 LCD screen. The 16x zoom is incredible. The pictures are excellent. Love the fact that I can crop pictures on the camera to print later, this is such a time saver. I wasn't looking for a camera to use for video, ...
, This is the camera I wanted to purchase in late 2010 but it wasn't available. (The ZS7 had a GPS which I didn't want.) When I saw this model available and handled it, I knew it was the one for me. It is easy to operate in the AF mode and that is most...

, Panasonic makes great cameras and this one keeps the bar high. Camera has a solid feel to it. Easy point-n-shoot for those care free moments but plenty of features if you want to dig in.
, I bought this camera for a mountain camping trip and couldn't be more pleased with how the pictures turned out. The 16x optical zoom is worth the price alone and allowed for some great closeup pictures of wildlife that would not have been possible wit...

, I use this camera for my real estate business as well as for personal photos. It is very easy to use, has a great zoom and takes wonderful pictures.
, Filaments were in the lens and in each photo i took. would have liked a booklet with instructions in addition to a disc. Not practical when traveling.
, I love, love, love this camera. I had a perfectly adequate Olympus camera before this one, but I was always dissatisfied with the picture quality. I was doing research before buying a camera for a couple of upcoming trips, and was impressed that a came...
, Love the hi speed burst. It really handles my shakiness well. It is nice that I can put it in my purse but has a powerhouse zoom. Had a hard time finding a neck strap-I don't like to have it on my wrist. It doesn't have good grips, they could have ad...
, I did so much research before buying my camera, we are talking about days spent on many websites and hours spent in stores looking at the models. This camera was by far the best one. The only problem I have with it is the size, its just a little large ...
, I gave her one for Xmas as she loves birding from our deck. The 16x zoom is perfect. The image quality is excellent. Auto-Focus can be a bit tricky but once you are used to it, you get some really great shots. She keeps telling me- even now - how much ...
, WAnted a superzoom that took good pictures at full zoom and fit in a small package for traveling. This answered the bill.

, I have owned four digicams, Canon A610 was my favorite with good battery life (4 AA batteries) and lots of easily accessed features but 5 MP and small screen. The others are also-rans. This Panasonic is not as easy to use as the Canon but has better pi...
, All I can say is that I had great expectations for this camera and it hasn't disappoint me at all. I had to buy it for my last camera died on me and I was going on a trip. The optical zoom is great specially for a point-n-shoot, and for the price! I r...

, We travelled with this camera and could not have been happier with its use and the pictures. Incredibly easy for the novice point and shoot, but offers much more for those who are creative photographers.
, I'm really enjoying this camera. It takes great pictures in good to average lighting. It could use some improvement in low lighting. It does an excellent job recording videos. I compared it to other cameras, and they had issues such as sound cutting o...
, Excellent 16x Zoom, good quality pictures, no blur pictures in movement.
, Alright, I needed a family picture taking camera, nothing too fancy or pricey. This is best. Remember to use the specify camera features for ever picture you take. It really improves the quality. Ex. Use outdoor setting, low lighting,etc. With that in ...

, The camera shoots great pictures and the zoom is awesome for a little point and shoot. The anti wabble feature works great. As long as the target you are taking a picture of is still your golden. The camera takes better pictures outdoors than inside, n...

, This is my second of the Panasonic Lumix brand. The cameras are amazing and take wonderful pictures even in their default setting. The optional features work well and the camera features an incredible zoom. My other favorite feature is the ability to t...
, This is a good all-round camera. The zoom and resolution are great for such a small, light, cam. Based on discounts, I would guess this model will soon be replaced, or already has been. PROS: Great overall performance for it's size, weight, and cost. ...
, I love this camera! I have had several point and shoot cameras and this is by far the best. The zoom is really good and there are several different settings and once you learn when to use what you can take pictures anywhere. We went to some caverns and...

, I just got it today after a long contemplation, having the 16x zoom is amazing, the details are pretty good, and the interface is easy for amateurs. I still have to test the Panoramic setting but I gotta say, I am very satisfied! So far ;)
, This a great camera. I was looking for a small size camera with great zoom, and this Panasonic it's exactly that. You may find smaller cameras on the market, but with few zoom. The 16X zoom it's just amazing. The picture clarity and definition is gre...

, I love this camera....it's easy to use, offers high quality resolution photos, and is small enough to carry in almost any bag. Granted, can't compare to an SLRP type...but for a compact camera, well worth the price. Great zoom, extremely functional.....

, Good picture quality and features including 16x zoom and 14.1 Megpixels in a compact camera. Panasonic quality at a decent price.

, FOUND IT TO BE A GOOD ALL AROUND AND HAS A GREAT NIGHT SHOOT FEATURE.
, I really like the compact size. For years, I fought small cameras, feeling that one had to have a bulky camera over the shoulder to achieve excellent results. No more. I will certainly use the wrist strap, as this one, like all small cameras would be e...
, I decided to get this camera after playing around with my co-worker's ZS5 model. Great camera. Best Buy didn't have the ZS5 but the ZS8 was on sale and of course, I got it. Again, it is definitely in the top 5 best purchases I've ever made. Let's s...

, This is a great little camera. A pocket fit, it makes quite printable images in good light.
, I am so glad I got this little camera. I use it almost every day to photograph something I'm interested in--birds, dogs, cats, plants, clouds. It does a very good job with all of these subjects.
, I have been buying Panasonic Lumix cameras for 5 years, have gone through at least 6 of them. They used to be more durable and impervious to dust. Now I find that dust gets behind the wonderful Leica lens leaving spots on all images. Grrrr...!
, Don't waste your money. I bought two Lumix cameras. First one died after a year. The second one developed the same problem many people complain about. The Leica Zoom Lens gets dust inside that you can't reach and it shows up as big dark spots and lines...
, Great camera, easy to use, takes terrific pictures. No complaints. I did put an SD card in because there was very little storage space built into the camera. Good battery life.

, This Panasonic Lumix ZS8 with a 16X Optical Zoom will replace a Canon ELPH which only has a 4X zoom.  For everyday use and travel it is the perfect size for pocket or purse and a good compliment to my Panasonic FZ35.  The 16X zoom sold me on this camer...

, This very pocketable gem is every bit as good as it's V-Lux Leica counterpart, minus the GPS and red logo... Perfect for Program mode snapshots and pretty good at zoom as well. The main reason I picked this camera up was it's near 100 dollar sale price...
, I purchased this long zoom travel camera for my next Alaska cruise. The camera has just enough features without being too complex to use, I just want a good point and shot to use on auto with the added ability to access some manual control once in a wh...

, I love this refrigerator! The lighting is awesome--there is plenty of room, and it is quiet, especially compared to my old Kenmore. The Lowes delivery people did an excellent job!
, We have had the fridge for a little over a month now and we love it! It has tons of space. The ice box is huge! We like the different features on the display. Especially the child lock. It prevents many unneccesary accidents. Samsung is a great brand...
, lots of room and features, a great product and will buy other products
, We just got ours delivered yesterday. I love it so far. There is a lot of space for tall items like gallons of milk or a 2-liter of soda. I really love the freezer. It's so much easier to see what I have when it's on several shelves instead of piled...
, This refrigerator was a replacement for another brand that went bad. We were excited with the value and features and were very happy with the unit for only a few days. This unit has a very BAD constant hum noice that comes from the interior wall...
, First one froze everthing to minus 25 degrees on warmest setting! and ran continuosly. Replacement refrigerator freezer compartment temperature has varied from 30 degrees to minus 20 on the same setting! Noisiest refrigerator ever owned. Ice maker...
, I liked the look of this unit but to date I can't say it's been good because it doesn't work. I took it home from the store, waited 24 hours and installed it. Nothing. No cooling but some very pretty blue lights to look at. So far it's sat in my...
, Bought this refrigerator in March of 2010. It was manufactured in February of 2010. It is now September of 2010 and my ice maker has officially died. Really? 6 months? Overall, if the ice maker were working, I would love this fridge. It's big, and I...
, My wife and I recently bought this refrigerator after our old GE died. This refrigerator has lots of storage room on both sides and is very quiet. This refigerator is well lit, organized, and easy to reach things without having to dig around inside. It...
, The ice dispenser is of a very low quality & operates very poorly. Instructions say push gently against the dispenser pad. In reality it is like pushing agains a BRICK WALL. Ice will sometimes wait 1 -5 minutes after galss is removed and more ice will...
, Pros: Good looking, nice led lights, sturdy door handles, great price for the features, and most of all a very quiet motor. I can hardly hear it running. I have not found any problems using the water dispenser or getting ice like other reviewers have...
, Very attractive appearance and good layout, however I find the way the ice cube dispenser works unusual and inconvenient in that when you push the lever past the first detent it doesn't dispense ice until you push in much harder past a second detent....
, Well..my repair man said it was time to purchase a new refrigerator, as it was too hard to get replacement parts for my existing model, which I purchased used in 1978. So I went shopping, looking at ALL models and makes.This model(and others by...
, I was in desperate need for a new refrigerator and really wanted a bottom freezer, but since it was an unexpected purchase I had to be more pratical, and purchase what I could afford. After looking at dozens of refrigerators, I found this one. I like...
, Great value, compact for a large capacity refrigerator, LED lighting very easy on the eyes. Freezer well designed and ice maker space savings work fine.
, was looking for the cheapest fridge when i showed up at the store and saw this unit.....i was done looking. i take delivery tomorrow but this thing is beautiful for the price inside and out. metal handles; awesome illumination inside, and cool...
, One of the features we looked for in a refrigerator was an easy to access filter for the water and ice despenser. We found this in the Samsung. Another great feature was the fact that there was extra space beside the ice maker. Most ice makers take up...
, We had to replace our old refrigerator, and this one fits just what we need. Great looks, great price, great space.
, superior quality, quiet, and functional. can't ask for more.
, Big, simple, and sweet. 5 weeks of ownership. No issue at all. No drip on water dispencer. Clean simple design = easy to clean.
, We purchased this model about a month ago but have exchanged it for the French door with bottom freezer due to the size. The space we have for the fridge was an exact fit for the 26 cu ft but had zero clearance on each side and did not cool as well....
, The overall look of the product is appealing. The ability to adjust the temperatures from outside of the refrigerator is an excellent feature. The numerous options are also nice and the ability to place the unit in an energy saver mode is also nice....
, What caught my attention about this product, besides the price, was its features. I also liked the design both inside and out.
, We really like it. It is QUIET. However, the designers shoud put the upper fridge light in the top back ceiling -- but be careful that the top fridge door shelf does not collide if cover is left open. The LED lights are not desirable (too dim), but are...
, Side by side fridge gives you much more organized freezer space than top or bottom freezers. Temp settings are digitally set from the door. Ice maker works great. Wife gets compliments from guests. Got it for a great deal with extended warranty just...
, Looks good. Good features. good price. Only thing I'm disappointed in is the ice maker It plugs up too easily when using cubes. Otherwise great product..
, We had to have 4 refrigerators delivered before receiving a new one without a dent or scratch...or a floor model. Make sure what you receive is a new machine and check the date inside. No problem with the icemaker, plenty all the time and it comes out...
, We love this refrigerator. It is roomy and very quiet. Everything is organized and easy to reach. The features are easy to use. So very glad we bought it.
, I will never ever buy another samsung product ever again after owning this product. It has been a nightmare. I've had the unit serviced 5 times within the warranty & twice out of warranty. It is still giving me problems. Beware of Samsung poor...
, We traded our 25+ yr refrigerator for this one about 3 weeks ago. I really wanted a french door but decided on this one b/c of the price difference. I am glad I did. We were concerned about the icemaker not making enough ice (family of four) but it has...
, i am very pleased with the value of the excelent product i purchased today. I will continue to puchase samsung products for all my needs in the future...
, hi we were talked in to this samsung its very hard to see if your getting cube or crushed ice it only makes 18 ice cubes in 24 hours .the handle has broke after two months of use and we have no kids or grand kids liveing at home. the new lighting is a...
, I LIKE IT IT MEET ALL MY EXPECTATIONS IT WAS INEXPENSIVE
, Very roomy. I love the LED lighting! So far, I love it!
, The panel buttons get 'bumped' too easily and you have to reset the button that was bumped. It can be frustrating; especially if you're in a rush. There's alot of room in the refrigerator section and the freezer section is pretty roomy too. I like...
, So far this fridge is performing admirably. It's a bit on the loud side, especially the ice maker, but the interior room and ease of use makes the noise acceptable. The water dispenser is a little messy, but it works great!
, first water driped then ice dispenser would not dispense now ice dispenser wont shut off ice all over the floor I had to open door to shut off the ice
, Love the side-by-side. Works great and is quiet. My only complaints is it needed to come with one more glass shelf and one more door bin in the refrigerator and there are not enough adjustments for either of those. Besides the above things, am very...
, Overall we are thrilled with our new fridge. It was an incredible value for the price. It's easy to use and very effecient. It's mostly very quiet, but you can hear when the ice machine is refilling. The water dispenser is faster than our last two...
, We purchased our first one of these in October 2011. It never seemed to work correctly, no matter how high we set the freezer temperature it left our ice cream solid as a brick. The fridge ran constantly - it never stopped. Then in February of this...
, Purchased this after having a bad experience with another refridge maker. So far (1 month in) the product works fine. Initial issue with ice maker, but that seems to have ironed itself out.
, After 15 years of the same fridge my wife and I decided we needed a new one. We looked at 8 or 9 different ones before purchaseing this one. has a lot of room and simple to operate . Fits right in with everything we have. Energy star on it is a plus....
, The worse part of this refrigerator is the ice maker. It is noisy, spits cubes across the floor when it isn't even being used. You can not get to the ice accept through the door so I can't empty or reach in an ice bin. The appliance overall is just a...
, I bought this refrigerator about 6 weeks ago. I wanted to wait a little before I submit my review so I have at least a little experience with this unit. The fridge looks really stylish. We had an old Frigidaire brand side by side going bad on us after...
, The downside is the icemaker is a little loud but overall it is a very quiet unit. The lights in it are really bright and there is lots of space in the refrigerator and freezer area..
, First off, this Samsung model, 330667, was made in Mexico, not China! After taking it apart per included instructions to get it into my house I can say that I'm very impressed with the overall build quality. It's assembled as well as any luxury car...
, It gets a 5 star for... organizational features pretty design Roomy Selves Space use of where the ice maker is It gets a 1 Lighting inside, which is very dull, they are LED and once you have the food in, its dark. Its dark in the freezer as well. Some...
, We upgraded from a 19 cubic foot fridge to this 26 cubic foot model. WOW! Its amazing how much more room we have.
, We have been extremely pleased with this refrigerator, it is extremely quiet ,in fact we checked the ice maker a few times because we never heard the ice fall. design is wonderful with plenty of space, shelves are easy to clean, and love the larger...
, this is the best Fridge ive ever owned, its to bad that its so big it took a lot of work to get it into my house and its going to have to stay with the house when i sell the place.. I guess i will just have to buy the next big Samsung Fridge for my...
, My new refrigerator is great! The icemaker puts out so much more ice than we used to get that we forget and end up getting ice cubes all over the floor. I love the new, huge 26 inch size, too. So much more room!
, This fridge seems to be living up to all it's hype. I haven't received an electric bill yet to see if it has made any difference, but I'm optimistic. Assembly and set up was easy and the controls and the interior layout are very intuitive, something...
, I purchased my refrigerator in April 2010. It is now January 2012 and the freezer portion of the refrigerator decided to quit on me. It is now out of warranty and all of the fixes will have to come from my pocket. I never thought a Samsung prodect...
, Product is good but please pay attention to the measures provided. They are not accurate.
, Like the appearance and the overall great value and new technology
, The fridge looks great and I like ability to remove shelves and drawers to configure interior any way I like. However, the electronic ice/water dispenser is annoying. Hold button down for 3-seconds and get the ice you don't want (shaved/whole cubes). H...
, We bought this fridge and have had it for 6 months. We absolutely love it! It has ample space in the fridge and freezer. The through the door water and ice is so pretty and easy to navigate through the options.
, Had the thing only for a few weeks when I noticed a minor leak underneath... Service call was answered very quickly but then I was transferred 4 times and had to repeat my info and my problem to each of the people I talked to. Now that its fixed, the f...
, Overall very happy. Read the manual re: temperature controls and ice/water. Previous refrigerator shelves/knobs were breaking (10 years old), water dispenser nozzle broke. Only item we needed to get used to is nozzle for this refrigerator points back, ...
, I HAVE HAD IT FO ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AN SO FAR IT HAS BEEN PERFECT
, Samsung may be well known for their electronics (TV's, etc.), but be forwarned - they know very little about design of kitchen appliances. I've purchased many kitchen appliances - having moved every two years for the past 20, and also owning several re...
, love this fridge, plenty of space for everything. Freezer is good too, with lots of space.
, I am happy with the quality and energy efficiency.

, A great blender at a great value!! I would recommend!!
, We bought this item to replace a broken blender. It has opened up a new world of ease in the kitchen. I have found at least twenty uses for it in making muffins, cookies and soups alone!
, This is an impressive machine. Durable, sleek and powerful. I was debating on whether to get a food processor or a blender and this unit solves that problem. It's a little smaller than some, but has a glass blender as opposed to plastic. Just not crazy...
, This blender is awesome; it handles a big job and includes the attachments for a food processor so I can get rid of that old huge clunky thing and gain a little extra cabinet space... the only downside is the pitcher has no good lip for pouring! Even p...
, We've always owned Cuisinart blenders and wanted a food processor. This had both for the same price as the blender we usually purchase. The blender function is the same and we've found the food processor to be useful and of good quality. We use the ble...
, It's a very good and strong blender. It purees very fast. Like the pulse button.
, I thought this would be a nice combo food processor and blender. Looks like it would break easy made of plastic it blends good with a glass jar blender.
, I usually use a blender twice a day and need one that will last. This one is easy to operate and I like the fact it has a glass pitcher. It's sleek look and power made it an easy choice for my kitchen. I feel that it was a great price for the Cuisinart...

, The best looking blender I have ever owned. Great features and black-stainless steel combination looks fantastic.
, When we were looking for a blender, we were seeing models for about $100.00, right next to food processors for the same price. When we say this combo setup for the same $100.00, it was hard to argue. The food processor only has a handful of attachments...
, Happy with the blender. It works well. Great deal for the price.
, I've had this machine for about a month now and it works very well.
, I like this two-in-one style. Our previous blender was a bust so this experience has been great. I was a little worried about the whirr of the motor but learned how to use finesse with the buttons and the blades. Great for shakes, salsas, veggies, and ...

, Good blender, good brand. My wife use it every day and the performance of this blender is excellent. I recommended it even for commercial use.
, I'm down sizing. It does the work of two larger appliances with half the storage space needed. I recommend it to any one with limited space. It does a good job chopping vegetables and nuts. It does a fair job with pizza dough.
, I like the blender, it's better than the ninja. Just wish it would crush ice better.
, Overall the Cuisinart PowerBlend Duet 7-Speed Blender is very good choice to have in any kitchen. I like it!

, Great product and value. I recommend the dual blender/food processor.

, I got this as an open box item. So, I got it very cheaply. It's a great machine. However, I do not think I would have paid the $400 original price. For the money, it's an excellent microwave.
, The installers were great and very professional, but having two appliances, (dishwasher and microwave oven) delivered at the same time, with two sets of directions flying at us, was a little rushed. Was not told, until I called the store, the dishwashe...
, Over all this is a great product. The fact that it is a larger capacity was a huge selling point. The auto turn off and power saver modes are great for features. This is a great microwave.
, I've only had this item for two-three months now and everybody in the household loves it. I also like the dark interior because as it gets older, it will not show any stain marks. The rack also help when i have multiple items to heat up. Absolutely no ...
, We found that the oven was easy to use and we like the features like the auto light, 30 sec. button, etc. We are still learning how to use it so this is about all I can say at this point.
, Great product for the price and I would recommend it to my friends.
, I have to say that my Salesman Dave picked this microwave out for me, and he did a great job. This is a powerful basic microwave, which is exactly what I wanted. It is quite beautiful. I love the dark gray interior! Very large interior. Easy to use. He...
, Overall it's a great microwave for a great price. With many extras and nice look it is definetly one I would recommend
, Bought as an open item, was missing a few install parts, but we managed. Overall great microwave. Multiple speed vent is a plus. Light is bright. Relatively quiet. Capacity is good.
, We bought this GE model because we were told it was the only one that would fit into the space we had above our range.  Our old GE spacemaker microwave died after about 20 years of constant use.  We were very satisfied with the old GE unit so had no co...
, Found this unit in the returned/reduced area of the store. Price was marked down but still in the box. Great deal and matched the gas range I was buying also.
, Fan -- is way to loud, even on low. Relative sound (noise) should be mentioned in specs.
, Fan better and quieter than last model. Mounting nuts are flimsy and caneasily be driven inside microwave so exercise caution when advancig mountig bolts.
, Having to replace appliances do to old and failing, this has been very nice to use. The reheat option has not overcooked on me yet and the steam option is very nice also. So far I am very pleased. The only thing I don't like is how noisey the exhaust...
, Good and simple replacement for a 14 yr old GE unit that died. The black interior will take some getting used to. The recirculating vent kit was confusing. Prices for the kit varied from $7 to $70.
, Great oven but lousy installation instructions. Some of the steps were not correct, especially for the installation of the exhaust adapter on page 13. Personnel at the 1-800 number were not able to help me but I eventually figured it out how to attach...
, Doesn't heat very quickly even though it says it is 1000 watts
, We have had multiple versions of this microwave at this and prior homes. The tray is larger, which is nice. Controls are similar with a few variations. I use auto defrost more because it is more accurate-even tells you to turn food over. The only thing...
, Item came in record time works great always find just what the customer wants
, This microwave is large inside and has many good settings.
, really love the features and ease of use, door is a little hard to pull open
, We were replacing a 14 year old GE microwave with this unit and had been pleased with most of the features of the previous unit, with the exception of the effectiveness of the exhaust fan.  The new unit is attractive and does its job pretty well.  Unfo...
, The delivery team installed the microwave quickly without any trouble.
, I love this microwave. I decided against other models with the control panel at the bottom due to the splatter possibility. This one is very easy to keep clean and works perfectly. Much faster than my previous microwave.
, Have had this for about one month now. This replaced a broken Frigidaire brand. Both had similar features, but the GE microwaves very even, has the convenience of the buttons on the bottom and with the curve on the bottom of the door provides a unique ...
, disapointed in popcorn feature. Tried setting my own time. Same results. Leave a lot of kernels 'unpopped' ;>( Other than that - it is a GREAT appliance. I like everything about it.... vent, ease of operation and looks great.
, Nice looking, easy to clean. Can't cook popcorn nearly as well as our old Sharp Carousel. I mean it is terrible at popcorn and it's 1000 watt. The touch pad buttons require some effort to work. The 4 speed fan is great but loud, I am looking to wrap so...
, Not a whole lot to report here. I got this microwave because it has actual hard buttons for the light / vent / and a power-save option. The vent has 4 settings and high speed of 400CFM (highest on market currently, but not exclusive to this microwave)....
, We've had this microwave for about 2 months now and absolutely love it. I'm not a big 5 star review writer unless i really like something and would 100% buy it again without hesitation. Well, this is that product. It has a dark blue interior, which sta...
, We received this microwave on on 7-19-12. The man arrived to install the microwave on 7-22-12. When we unpacked the microwave the back corner was very badly damaged..The microwave had to have been badly damaged prior to having been placed into its box ...
, This unit is easy to use and heats food and defrosts quickly. I would recommmend it highly
, Microwave frozen meats etc and heating up leftovers and frozen veggies
, Fan sounds like a turbine at the highest setting, but it's one of the higher fan outputs and quiets considerably on lower settings. Haven't learned the extra functions yet, have used it for heating only, but the express settings make that a simpler pro...

, Ninety-five percent of features suit me very well. The lowest shelf of the door could have a higher guard rail. The capacity and organization of the freezer compartment disappoint, however - I could not use the automatic ice cube hookup, but there is...
, I've owned mine for 3 years now and it works great. Very quiet, can hardly tell it's running. Love the freezer on bottom and slide out drawer, handy to put things in and out. Love the eye level fridge section.
, I had never purchased a fridge before, so I was a little unprepared for how expensive it would be in general. This one is definitely a bit pricey, but because of the layout of my kitchen, the reversible door was a must, and then I decided to splurge on...
, Installed this myself, piece of cake, very nice finish, door seal is hard to break open sometimes, just cashed my energy star rebate today, 30$, all round nice appliance!

, I could use a little more freezer room but other than that this is a wonderful appliance.
, After reading about this refrigerator in Consumers Report, I expected quiet operation and this appliance is extremely noisy with sudden loud sounds. Even the motor is loud. Also, despite frequent attempts, we cannot get the door to close by itself. It ...
, The old refrigerator had been reconditioned 5 years ago when it was 16 years old and the technician said if we got another 3 to 5 years out of it that would be great. He was right: we got another 5 years. He also said that refrigerators don't last that...

, There is nothing like fresh ground coffee. I have bought several grinders in the past, all have given out on me. This one works beautifully and grinds enough for several pots. If everyone knew about this, Starbucks would be in trouble!
, I only give this 4 stars, because it does get grinds all over the counter. However, we were able to deal with this by using a large rounded paper plate under it. Much better. Also, you can avoid unwanted ground disbursement by leaving the lid on the...
, I have been using mine for 4 years now, 2 pots daily still work as good as new.

, Love this grinder now. When I first got it ,the grinder had a defective bean compartment cover. The cover was cracked and warped.. Macy's however sent a new one immediately. Excellent product. Excellent customer service.
, I bought this coffee grinder to grind whole grains (I don't drink coffee). I like that it has a large holding capacity and it grinds well. It is pretty loud and can get stopped up with items such as nuts or flaxseed. Overall it does a nice job though.

, i love this stove top,easy to clean over spills from teenagers. should have done this years ago.THANK YOU.
, My old majic chef just started to give us trouble. Some eyes would not turn off properly and some would not heat up right. decided to replace it with a whirlpool product.

, Whirlpool products are quality through and through. Our dishwasher is efficient and extremely quite. Our Frig has great storage and our new cook top is awesome as it is so easy to clean and heats up so quickly as well as maintains even heating temperat...
, Front big burner hotter than dial says and back burners hardly heat. Have to turn back burners on high to get any heat and front big burner I have to keep on very low or it will burn food.
, I have always used Whirlpool products and to this day and am pleased with them. Would recommend to anyone needing a new appliance.
, We searched several months for a drop-in stove which would enhance our kitchen make0over. Some were over-priced, some lacked style, and some dependability. We choose the Whirlpool because all the features listed above made the fit. Very happy with th...
, I've had this cooktop for about 6 months now and I like how quickly up comes up to temp compared to my old cooktop. The surface is like a black vehicle....looks great when it is perfectly clean but it shows dust and every little spot. Super easy to cle...
, The medium size burner seems to be a little small in size; It maybe best to have 2 medium burner than 2 small burner
, I bought this cooktop in February 2013 and shortly after using the color faded around the hot plates. The cooktop is not used very often and I maintain it pretty good not using any chemicals to clean, but it is fading under the surface. It is a very hi...

, I have been very pleased with this cooktop, with the exception of it being a little hard to clean.
, Quality product with sleek design. Easy to clean and use
, I wish the knobs were a little farther apart to make cleaning between them easier. You have to take them off to clean.
, There are only two of us in this house. So the big burner in the front right should be in the back left and the smaller one should be in the right front. The burner indicator's are not very easy to see and we turn on the wrong burners constantly. The w...

, Beautiful, easy to keep clean inside and out. I love to cook and the heating elements responds to my temperature needs without fail. LOVE IT
, This unit replaced an electric coil cooktop. As advertized, it is much easier to clean. It only takes a damp sponge to remove most spills and splatters from the cookstop surface itself. The edges are also thin and sealed well against our laminate count...
, I love the easy clean up of the cook top. The quick heat up is great. My husband wanted to get an induction cook top, but I wanted this one. I'm so glad we got this one instead. It's beautiful. I'm a fan off Whirlpool, we also have an oven. Clean up in...
, product ok, like the style serves our purpose has very nice features

, easy to clean but must clean all the time, but easy to do, love the extra burner do wish the bigger one was in the back, color and style works for us

, Going from gas or an older style electric coil type range it takes a bit of getting use to since you can see the red glow of the elements cycle on and off. Being a flat surface discovered that some of my pots had bugled bottoms, not the ranges fault an...
, Really like the way the burners heat up quickly and cool down relatively quickly. We had old coil type burners that took forever to get up to cooking heat, and then stayed hot for so long that food would stick to the bottom of the pot even if you tur...
, My wife and I replaced an older whirlpool cook top that we used for 28 years and we are amazed at how fast this unit heats. We are very happy with our purchase!
, Replaced our Jennair with the whirlpool and could not be happier. Placement of knobs better than the Jennair. Heats very even and fast with excellent control of temperatures. It does show soil and fingerprints but the included cleaner works very well w...
, The Whirlpool glass cook top is ok to cook with. The glass top is difficult to keep looking nice. It often looks like it has a haze on it...even when I just wipe up drips of clear water. I don't like the big burner in the front. Also the big burner is ...
, Heats up quickly. The glass top is so much easier to clean than the standard coil cooktop/range, and itlooks fantastic on my new black granite countertop.
, I had a Kitchen Aide before and I though this would be similar. It isn't. The knobs are hard to turn, the temp control and timer are digital and you have to keep pressing the up or down arrow until your temp is found. The cook top is NOT easy to keep c...
, The performance in this cooktop is excelent, heats up right away! Problem is only after 1st use it scratches very very easily! Not worth the price!
, I really like my new glass cooktop, but the only problem I have with it is that if cooking on simmer I have to turn it up a little in order for it to simmer.

, I had a gas stove and was nervous to use electric. This cooktop is very easy to use.
, works great
, Superb unit for the price!
, Within one week of installation there is a small scratch visible in the glass, and the stainless steel border is scuffed up. It is not very durable and already looks well worn. It is also extremely difficult to keep clean, and requires constant attenti...
, After the installation, I couldn't believe how much of a positive visual impact the cooktop made to the kitchen. With its first use, however, the bottom of the dutch oven scratched the element. The second use was for sauteing, and that pan also scratch...
, The cooktop is extremely hard to clean & scratches very easily!!!!!!!!!!!
, The all-black styling was our choice; to compliment our granite top kitchen renovations. We are having difficulties, however determining the element choice markings.
, The stovetop was a replacement from my previous one which was cracked. It fit perfectly and it was easy to use and easy to clean
, I wish I hadn't waited years to purchase a glass cooktop to replace my coil top electric stove. This Whirlpool product is great in every respect and fits perfectly in my updated kitchen. It is attractive, well designed, and very easy to clean as well. ...
, Especially satisfied with black top. It is easy to wipe up spills. of course some spills get burned on or some bottom pan metal rubs off, since glass is harder than metal. Use of a glass cook top cleaner/polish will effectively clean all of this. Contr...
, This product looks great and is easy to clean. It helped transform our kitchen into one with modern conveniences and visual appeal.
, I purchased this unit as a replacement for the damaged unit installed by the builder in my 6 year old spec home. Overall, we have found this unit to be a very nice step even though it is not an upgraded model (just a later model year from the original)...
, this product is easy to use, heats up evenly and most of all is easy to clean
, My wife and I have been enjoying the cooktop's performance on anything we cook. Although we have had it a short time, seems to be an energy efficient device that is well designed for durability.
, Love having the knobs on the far right side...so much easier to keep them clean if they are not in the middle of the burners. I tend to use the two most left burners most of the time and rarely even have to clean the knobs. Great!
, The whirlpool stove we bought it is a modern looking, reliable product. The cost of this stove was relatively inexpensive compared to all the amenities of the stove. I would recommend this product.
, I love the look of my cooktop in my kitchen. I replaced my old 4 coil burner electric cooktop with this model and I love the room I have on the flat surface of this model.
, So far we have enjoyed the couple of months we have had our new glass cook top. Makes for easier cleaning than the old burner with drip pans.
, I built a new island in my kitchen and ordered this cook top to put in it. I love how easy to clean and maintain it is. I even use it as an ironing board! The cooking stations on it are the perfect size for me and my use! It is was very easy to install...
, Modern looking heats up fast easy to clean! Love it
, Love my cooktop. Looks great, easy to use, easy to clean. Not one thing about it that I don't like.

, Cooktop is easy to use, heats quickly and easy to clean. I would definitely recommend this product.

, Great microwave for the price. We replaced an older over the stove microwave with this model. It is great, big, and easy to use. The only down side is that it is bigger than out older one and it is closer the top of the stove. If you don't have a lot o...
, lasted about 2.5 years. cost more to fix it than by a new one will nt buy this brand again.
, I was pleasantly surprised to have a guide for the defrost, reheat, and cook buttons on the inside when you open the door. There is a number for the item and a number for weight or amount. Then wah la...its done your way, no more guessing.
, I needed a new microwave with range hood combination. Since I didn't know if I already had a place to vent it to the outside; I needed a product that offered both in and outside venting options. As it turned out, I had the vent installed to send airflo...
, Was unsure about the microwave but it has met and exceeded ALL my expectations. The installation instructions were a little confusing but once I had a grasp the install was a breeeze. The oven works very well for everything from a reheat to cooking a m...
, Bought this for a rental cabin and it serves the purpose very well.
, Easy to install.....perfect for a single person..........
, The microwave was easy to install and looks great. It operates quietly and does everything I expect of a microwave.
, So far so good. No complaints. Has the features I needed. Installed quickly and easily.
, Everything is very good about this machine and the install directions were very good. Still a difficult job for DIY if you have not done one before, but just follow the directions carefully. My old wall cabinet above range was not the full 30 inches ab...
, Good quality and easy to clean. The microwave has great capacity.
, For the price, this is a good microwave. I don't use it for anything more than warming up stuff for the kids. It's pretty quiet, easy to use and there isn't a lot of extras which is fine by me. There is no inner rack which I also prefer since I have ...
, We were replacing a 17 year old Whirlpool microwave. The unit has the features we wanted. Installation was not too difficult, although it would be good if a universal template was available to reduce the drilling into the cabinets. Basic unit that work...
, Priced right yet excellent product. It is for my rental property and I hope it holds up.
, Had a some trouble trying to install. Had to call for some help. Other than that it is quite and very simple to use. Great at night when you need to heat up something half asleep.
, Easy installation, quieter than our last one. Good price for a basic model. Only had it in for a week, working great so far!
, THIS IS A GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE AND IT DOES THE BASICS PLUS MORE.
, I received this unit a week ago. I noticed that it was shipped with a styrofoam bottom and cardboard top and shrink wrapped around the center. Not very good to be shipped so unprotected! Nothing looked damaged or out of place so I assumed all was right...
, DO NOT throw the box away until AFTER installing! It has a template built in but it is NOT marked. Luckily the trash had not come yet. The cheat sheet for the key pad codes is inside the microwave where the door seals which is nice. Its convenient but ...
, Like everything about it. The features are a nice addition and very easy to use, it sits lower then my other one so you can see inside which is great and love the popcorn button it hasn't burned yet like my other one. Overall very pleased.
, Priced fairly and good quality. Easy to install. Please with this purchase.
, Since it is new, I have no idea about the actual quality=longevity of the product. My Frigidaire lasted 10 years.
, The microwave matches with other appliances in the kitchen. It was a good deal when bought with other cooking range
, I bought this microwave because my other one stopped working. I don't know how old the other one was since it came with the place. I do like this one a lot better. More features has a button for pizza and to soften foods and even a night light. I was a...
, Great microwave for the price. Slight learning curve for the quick buttons. The fan is quiet and the unit looks good.
, Does everything that it is supposed to do. I have no complaints.
, A good mcrowave,worksjust like the old one.The door opens & closes easily & has a simple layout.The only drawbacks it has,to me at least, is that the LED readouts could be larger & sharper,the flat panel buttons are hard to push,& there is not an optio...
, We measured and this fit perfectly when it arrived. We unboxed it and plugged it in. Very easy install.
, We are happy with our new microwave. It has been easy to use and was easy to install.
, Works great so far! Hope it can last longer than the last microwave I bought of another brand. We will see, I guess. It's one of those appliances that you don't notice too much unless it breaks on you, and then you really miss it.
, make sure to take the right measurements before you purchase this product. if I had to do it all over again, I would pay to have the product installed unless you have time to burn
, Easy to install. Cooks well not too loud. It's really a good microwave for the price.
, The Whirlpool Micowave replaced an older model that had seen better days. I wanted an under-the-cabinet model in white, so that is what I purchased. So far everything works well and the programming for different tasks is easy. I'm pleased with my purch...
, had this for 1 month - works great so far - no complaints
, This microwave looks great, functions very well, extremely user friendly.
, I could not be happier with this microwave. So glad I read the reviews and chose this one.
, great value , easy to use and set up but need at least two people to help install it. Overall it's a great deal.
, It was an easy replacement for the GE model we had. Simple to install. Few tools needed. Up in about 1 hour.. even with all the measuring for the top side fastening.
, Overall the product is working for the short period I have had it and I am enjoying it
, What a nice microwave. It runs quietly, cooks everything I've tried in it efficiently, is easy to clean.. I'm just so glad I purchased it.
, Fast delivery but was damaged in shipment. The dent doesn't show when installed.

, So far these ear plugs have held up. Hopefully they will last longer than my previous ones that came with my iPhone. I was looking for something that could take a beating and I think I found it.
, Good sound, it would be nice to have something to keep it in, the packaging is too bulky. I like to use it with my smart phone for music.
, I've had 3 sets of these ear buds. I work at a golf course, use them pretty hard and everyday. They sound great, and do a decent job of drowning out back ground noise, including the mowers. I just wish they could make the cords last longer. The cord ge...

, Disappointed in quality of these ear buds with mic
, Headphone lacks bass and mic is placed too low the other person on the phone cannot hear me when I talk I had to manually bring the microphone higher or shout while I am talking. I am returning it.
, Great product at a great price. Crisp, clear sound for both parties. Have not found any cons with this product.
, These head phones are not good you would think because it's sony they would be but this is not the case. I bought them for my smart phone because I can't use wireless headset any they have poor sound and don't function well.
, I am a runner and they are horrible for running. Sound is good but they will not stay in your ear. Its a shame that I spent almost $40 for them and they wont stay in the ear. Sound is good but they definitely are not made for sport.
, This is my third set of Sony ear buds with microphone for use with phone. All others have been great but this set may be faulty. The microphone is not adjustable and it rests on my stomach instead of near my mouth so people can hear me. I should just t...
, I thought Sony would have a Lil better quality got putting their name on it,i know they weren't expensive but shouldn't slack on the performance.
, They sound really good, but they keep sliding out of my ears no matter what sized buds I use. The design also makes it easy for them to unknowingly rotate in ear, which can be frustrating and uncomfortable. I've used a lot worse, but at this price poin...
, I randomly found these headphones when I was returning another product I had purchased and decided to do an exchange. They're great!
, It reminds me how I want better audio from my earbuds...seems hard to come by at this price.
, Bought these headphones to use while at the gym, wanted a set of headphones that would control volume and track selection on my Iphone.These headphones had great sound, plenty of bass but the controller keep malfuntioning. It constanly would not change...
, I use it regularly and love the sound and clarity.
, I returned this item the very next day. I was looking for something with more comfort and quality than the earbuds that came with my iPhone. This item was somewhat more comfortable but the sound quality was less. Overall - not worth the money.
, Bought these because I did not want to spend more the $30, but now that I have them they are not really worth that much. They are very comfortable to wear, and the sound is good as long as l don't move. When the cable rubs against my clothing the sound...
, Sounds just like the average buds you get for $10 at a clearance store. I bought them since I had a $10 rewards coupon, my total price was $22, but even 22 is too much. You are only paying for the brand, nothing special here. They would be awesome in t...
, I use these earphones primarily for conference calls while traveling. They work great and have really good sound quality. The soft ear pieces allow for them to fit and stay comfortably in my ears. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for an ...
, I really like the sound of the headphones but the reason I got the headphones was for the microphone, and it's too far down the cord for the person on the phone to even hear what I was saying. I expected it to be by my chin but its almost down to my wa...
, Not the best model of sony headphones, I loved an old model the store used to carry
, Bypass this one and upgrade to a better quality...
, Its not bad, but the microphone is placed too far from ones mouth so it picks up a lot of ambient noise and makes you have to speak loudly. The volume control is of poor design and it's not loud enough, so its hard to hear when you are in a noisy place.
, Nice. I like the built-in microphone. Good product.
, The sound is great, but the microphone is too far from my mouth. I have to wrap the cord around my ear to bring it up level to my mouth. Microphone works fine when close to my mouth, but people can't hear me well if I don't move it closer to my mouth. ...
, bought these for my picky teen. got a thumbs up which is hard to come by these days. lol
, the sound to meet you sounds good. the remote control works well also. The microphone works fine as well as long as you hold it up to your mouth. it would be helpful to have a shirt clip on the cord to help lift the microphone higher toward your mouth.

, OtterBox is known for delivering quality products to its consumers.This model is no exception. It packs durability and long lasting protectionin a sleek and fashionable casing. i definitely recommend it to any Iphone 4 owner!
, If you seriously need a case that will absolutely protect your phone, this is your only choice. Solid as a rock, even your buttons and connections are protected. The reviewers who said the case doesn't match up with the headphones jack are incorrect....
, I would have given this 4 stars, but when you spend $50 on a case, it's not too much to expect that the hole for the headphone jack is over headphone jack on the phone. I don't know if this was meant for the iPhone 4 and not the 4S, but the package...
, I bought this case back in Feb 2011 when I got my I ph. I have dropped my phone several times and even a few on hard tiles. My phone works fine. I have a few dings in the casing, but ph is still in mint condition. I would tell anybody who drops things...

, I do not recomend this product. I bought it along with my new iphone and in a week the clip broke off that holds the phone in the holster. Best Buy would do nothing, I was told to go to Otter Box to have it replaced. Should have lasted longer than a week.
, The case is awesome at protecting from drops and protecting the screen. However, I have the iPhone 4 w/ Verizon and the case doesn't exactly line up perfectly. The headphone jack hole doesn't line up and isn't accessible w/out lifting the small flap...
, I had no concerns about the case if I were to ever drop my phone, but the cover for the charger location was poorly designed. The protective flap kept coming undone and felt as if it would tear off.

, i have only had this ac for 1 week and so far it is everything it was advert. to be it was easy to install 2 man for lifting ac. my only complaint is i have a faulty gfi plug connected to the ac and does not reset very well excellent at cooling 2nd...
, Works well, no problems so far - much quieter than my old machine
, Our old Frigidaire lasted 15yrs, finally conked out this summer so when I saw this one on sale I had to purchase. It is fairly quiet (I don't think there is a silent air conditioner) and it cools two rooms with no problem. I would recommend this...
, I bought this for my sister, who lives in our old family home. She said: It was easy to install; quickly cooled the 12' x 15' bedroom on one of the lower settings, and she loves the remote!
, I live on the top floor of my building, and it gets hot up here. This unit has kept my 3 bedroom apartment cool and comfy and so far not too bad on my electric bill. I would recommend this unit to my mother its that good.
, I've had this unit for approx. 2 months and it exceeds my expectations. It keeps 3 big rooms steady at 71. Thank you Walmart and Frigidaire. Gary
, Nice unit for a 110V AC. Easy to install.
, So far so good. I'm giving a second one a try I will keep my fingers crossed.
, I purchased this ac unit during a string of 100+degree days in Chicago. I picked it because it was the largest btu I could get befor having to go to a 220 outlet. It arrived within 3 business days, which was great for a 97cent s&h fee. However I live...
, This seems to be a good air conditioner. It cools our 900 square foot main floor and does a good job. It can keep it at 70 or 71 in 90 + weather. We have been running nonstop for weeks and no issues whatsoever.
, I have a large room with a valted ceiling 23ft.X20ft. with southern exsposure that gets lots of sun on two sides of the room. We are having 90 to 100 days for several months I needed the largest AC window unit I could find that runs on 120V. This...
, Took some time to get her installed, but that is where the savings are hidden. The instructions were clear and well presented. Slid her in, plugged her up and switched her on ... wah la, she went right to work and hasn't taken a break since.
, We needed a new window unit and I did some searching all over, online and in stores. This was the biggest we could find that did not require a special plug (I'm not calling an electrician for a window unit). We could have got one for a little cheaper...
, I bought it when my Central A/C went out and it's gonna take on the Texas Heat until I can save up enough to replace the main unit... It's in the kitchen window and cools the kitchen, the dining room and the living room. A couple of fans help push...
, This products is suppossed to cool a 900 sf area and it does not my whole house is not 900 sf so no im not satisfied
, This is the largest AC we could find the would still work on reg. 120 V outlet, Anything larger was 220v and would have to have new electric work done. We ordered this air conditioner for our new home. House is about 1700 square feet and this is doing...
, Frigidaire has always been a trusted name in my family for as long as I can remember. This product holds up to that claim. Considering that, I am sure to have many years of enjoyment and comfort using this air conditioner.
, Runs well, is compact enough to fit a smaller window, arrived one full day after I ordered it. I'm very pleased. The unit is even lighter than the one it replaces with the same BTU's.
, Puts out more air and cools better than the 220 units I have previously used !
, Very satisfied. Cooled our downstairs very nicely. Would definitely buy another one.
, I actually had to order this air conditioner twice. The first one arrived with a huge crack down the right side ( the box showed no damage). So I re-ordered it on a Thursday night and by Monday early afternoon it arrived. It was a little more...
, I had a 10,000 btu that was just not cutting this horrible 100 degree heat, so I had to look for an affordable fix. I was either going to buy 2-3 more 10,000 btu a/c's or try 1 larger unit. I am so glad I went with this unit! I live in 1000 sq.ft....
, This air conditioner did what I need it to do. Very easy to use and install.
, Had to replace our old 15000 BTU air conditioner and we finally found this one online. It is a 110 volt which we wanted and it fit in the existing hole we had from the prior a/c unit, with minor adjustments. We have it permanently installed through the...
, This air conditioner replaced one that was over twenty years old. The old one would frequently blow the circuit breaker. This one is smaller and much quieter, It turns off and on automatically to adjust to the weather without settilng off lthe circuit...
, AC was easy to install, all materials were provided. I did have to modify the support brackets because I have storm windows and the unit is not designed to be used with them. I am very satisfied with the noise level (very quiet) and the cycling of the...
, I live in a long mobile home. We had problem keeping living cool during summer. With this air conditioner not only does it keep the living room and kitchen cold, but it helps keep the rest of the mobile home tolerable (not hot, but not cool). Most of...
, The air conditioner is fine, compact and has a relatively high capacity for being on 115V which was a requirement for my setup. It has easy to understand controls. My main problem was not selecting the air conditioner but getting it installed; a number...
, First off, you need to be an engineer to install this unit. Has a MAJOR design flaw in that the cooling vents point straight out of the unit, instead of being located at the top of the unit like all other air conditioners. Therefore, if you have the un...
, Purchased the unit last year and it has been a consistent performer especially on 90+ degree days where smaller units can really struggle in larger rooms.   The real appeal is the 15K btu power capacity that runs off a 115v outlet but beware that it ne...
, Cools the room fast. The only instructions are for permanent window mounting. No instructions for mounting the unit if you desire to remove it during the winter season. Unit is very heavy. There is some work required this is not an easy install. I reco...
, I live in a 1,200 square foot condo that is rather long and oddly shaped, and I was very pleasantly surprised how well this AC cooled my whole unit.
, It took two hours to install this unit by two muscular men. It is not as simple as other window AC units, which you just have to slide in the window and shut the door. And if you think I am an idiot, think again. I installed and assembled everything th...
, I really like this Unit and it's features. It quickly cools a quite large room, and the adjoining room no problem. It operates more quietly than I anticipated too. The remote control is an excellent feature and the fact that you can set the unit so it'...
, This unit cools very quickly , the fans arent that loud . also the interior where the duct work is located from the vents to the blower is made of styrofoam? I have never seen this before , its either cheaply made or its maybe because styrofoam wont ...
, Product itself seems good.  Cools my dining room, living room, entry way and gallery (960 sq feet of open area without doors) in about 1 hr. Is a bit noisy.  Installation was a nightmare.  Two experienced installers had trouble because 1) directions an...

, This product is GREAT NO MORE HOT DAYS!!!!

, It's all relative - any 18,500 BTU A/C unit is going to be heavy, and produce noise.  This unit replaced an ancient (25+ year-old) 15,000 BTU unit.  The output is the same as the old unit.  The new unit is much lighter (all new ones are lighter than th...

, air conditioner cools this top floor apartment very fast!!It is quiet, but might disturb some who are light sleepers if is in the bedroom.  Good value so far...I haven't received energy bill since it was purchased, but staying cool is my priority.
, Overall, a nice ac. Installed just in time for a late spring heat wave. It cools the area well. Operation is easy and the remote is a nice added feature. The filter is easily accessible for cleaning/replacing.
, Purchased this AC to replace a ten year old 18,000 BTU unit. Tis unit does not have the cooling power of the old unit. The remote control and energy efficient are nice add ons but the bottom line is that it cant get the same area past 77 degrees. Since...
, hope the kids in classroom dont break it. easy to use, powerful.
, It works great.I,m very happy with it.This summer i,m ready for the heat.
, We purchased this AC with the intentions of placing it in our kitchen. We get the thing up 2 flights of stairs( because even after spending $450 on it, they can't even ship it from UPS or FEDEX!! Got some man with a van to deliver it) and we find out...
, Purchased for tenant in apartment. He stated initially he AC did not cool in the sleeve through the wall but since he put it in the window he stated it is freezing him out. So all I can say is no complaints are a good start.

, Great and simple phone thats just a phone. Bought this to replace the previous version of this phone for my grandmother to use.
, Sound volume not strong, some people say my voice when I talk fades in and out

, Nice phone for the price if you only want a basic phone.
, For the price this is a good phone. It does what you need it to (call and text) but it doesn't have any fancy features. The call quality isn't excellent but again, for the price it is what you what expect.
, ok phone for a replacement if all you need is a phone. cammer on phone has poor picture quality.
, I bought this flip phone camera phone for my mom and she loved it. Shes old school and doesn't know how to lock a phone while in her pocket so this flip phone prevents pocket dialing.
, This is a very practical on the go phone if you are not wanting anything high tech or confusing.
, Is really good for the price I bought it for my grandma she love it
, I'm happy to have this phone, I broke the phone I had before and really liked, I didn't want to sign a contract for a new phone though I was eligible. I wanted to wait for awhile to see what I really wanted. This go phone gives me a chance to have phon...
, great inexpensive phone, compact, fits easily in pockets, easy to use, camera, texting, and bluetooth good features at a low price!
, Had a text 'Go' phone before this one and all it did good was pocket dial 911 all the time. Seems 'powers to be' get anoyed at that. So with the flip cover style phone I haven't pocket dialed 911. It is a good phone for just a vocal communication devic...

, Great for its purpose of occasional calls & text..
, The AT&T Z221 is a good flip phone if all You want is a phone.
, Overall, I guess it's a usable phone which I use mainly for emergencies. The range seems to be good and I am glad about this.

, 3g coverage works well. easy to use and understand. good reception and voice quality.
, It works great for local calls, the camera is a little hard to work at times but that's probably my fault as it works a bit different from my normal cell phone camera. Also I was shocked when it charged me for taking a picture when I did not access...
, I bought this phone at a great price, very basic and has all the features I want and use.
, Great value for a flip cell with blue-tooth and camera for someone who wants a basic flip cell such as a parent or grand-parents.

, I purchased this for a not too technical adept person and they have really liked the ease of use especially the shortcut keys.
, I accidently broke my BlackBerry Torch last week by dropping it in the sidewalk. Then I had to go look for a decent, little temporary phone I can use a little while until I can upgrade to a new phone. When I passed by this phone, I knew it would work...
, Considering its price, it a great phone. Wish it was made a little sturdier. Texting does take a long time. You need to press the go key to enter each word.
, This phone is not a smart phone, but if you are looking for a basic phone that has excellent call and text ability, then this is the phone for you. I also love the fact that it is so compact and easy to carry in your pocket. An excellent phone without...
, I bought this phone six days ago. Call quality is decent and the software is decent, but after one very small drop the front screen is totally done for. I know I shouldn't expect too much from a $40 cell phone, but I would expect the front LCD screen...

, Bought this phone as a gift for a newbie to cell phones and texting. It's working great. Easy for him to use. Good but,
, Takes good pictures, has alert when battery is getting low & a reminder to notify you of a missed call.
, A decent flip phone, which I prefer, would buy again.
, My mother can hear on this phone wish it was a little bit bigger is hard for her to call out
, The Z221 is much smaller than many phones I've had, so it's much easier to find a spot for when wearing close-fitting jeans or carrying a messenger bag packed with school stuff. I'm a bit of a klutz, so the poor thing's been through the wringer, and co...
, serves the purpose of a readable phone when away from home
, Small Screen, speaker quality not so good, but OK for the price. I only got this as an emergency phone, for a basic back up its ok.

, Great network where I live. No dropped calls and durable.
, i love this phone, price was cheap, and works well, my other phones which were expensive ones always broke or wouldn t work right
, Soooooo happy with this phone. Would recommend this to any senior citizen who does not want or use all the current technology. Easy to read numbers and letters.
, Great replacement for an old poor reception cell phone. Great value for the price. Store personnel were very helpful in helping me choose the right phone and having it working when I left the store.

, The control panel that supplies power to the rest of the unit went out on ours in 18 months. Cost of repairs would have been over $400. Too pricey of a machine not to last.
, This is an extremely expensive micro wave for the quality. Within the 1 yr warranty the control board went bad and Bosch refused to cover the part under warranty. Good thing I purchased an extended warranty. Believe me when I say I will never again...
, The picture is misleading. The surround does not come with the microwave. It is a counter top microwave with an optional built in kit. There are no part numbers listed for the extra kit you need to buy. For this price, the surround should come with the...

, Still deciding how much I like it.  Does good job at auto reheating.  Seems to take longer to heat water in a mug.  Popcorn setting is definitely useless unless you like half a bag of unpopped kernels.

, After much shopping, this was by far the best value for a semi-commercial unit when you only have 30. Warning the high output burners are serious high output
, I am now 55 years old, have been on my own since I was 18 and I have never had a stove so beautiful and functional. In fact, it does more things than I even use and yet was priced low enough that I was able to purchase it. Great value, great stove.
, 4 and 1/2 stars. Only issue is the surface under burners is too shiny and shows the shallowest scratch. You have to be very careful moving grates. Interesting that design has two largest burners at the front instead of traditional one large front and...
, Gas burners perform really well. The oven takes getting used to. On both Convection & Bake (mainly at high temperatures) items on the top rack burn - there's no sense in having so many racks if you can't use them all. I rarely us ethe baking oven...
, I have had my range for about a year and love it. It makes cooking so easy and even my husband has enjoyed using the grill. The range cleans quickly and stays shiny.
, The stove top is easy to keep clean, large pots of water boil rapidly, the oven bakes breads and cakes evenly and the baking drawer is very useful.
, Very good range with versatile top grates and nice controls.
, I love my new GE Double Oven C2S985SETSS Duel Fuel. It is wonderful. I just wish that after it was installed that a GE Tech could come and check it all out.
, We like the features of this range, but the stainless steel is very soft. Scratched within the first week or normal use.
, I love my new range. The reasons I didn't give it a 5-star, 1-the front panel should light up. The options can not be read without direct light. 2- the bottom drawer takes to long to preheat. Other than these 2 reasons, it is excellent. The dual...

, Chose this because it had professional cook top combines with two ovens in a small slide in space. We lIke this range so far but the instruction DVD was so poor as to laughable. GE would be better off skipping the cost of this and having customers just...
, We bought this range, the convection microwave and the 980RSS dishwasher for our newly renovated kitchen. A dual fuel range sounded strange at first but we decided it is really the best of both - a gas cook top, which we wanted to replace our old drop...
, This range feels good. The components, grates, doors, griddle, etc. are solid. The cook top is easy to clean. The full surface design of the grates makes it easy to slide pots on and off of the flames. The griddle works well and is easy to clean....
, If you buy this range, be aware the LED display is greenish blue and not cobalt blue like the fridge. microwave and dishwasher. It looks like a mis-matched piece.
, I really enjoy this oven, however for the first time I baked a green bean casserole in the lower oven while baking a ham in the mail oven the casserole came out with a bad taste similar to using too much lighter fluid on charcoal when grilling. Is...
, We recently did a total kitchen remodel and wanted a dual fuel stove. It has been a pleasure to cook on from the start. We have to pull out the instructions one these days, but why this range is perfect. Every aspect of the range is wonderful, very...
, I'm still discovering all that my range can do. I did cook a whole chicken in the convection oven in 20 minutes! I love that it has a warming/baking drawer too. And of course, it's really pretty! I'm enjoying cooking again!
, Have owned this range for a couple of months and am afraid to use it -- only used it a few times. The top of the range should be a more durable product other than stainless steel -- it scratches just from gently wiping it --never mind having to worry...
, This range gets noticed! Even a pro in the restaurant business was very impressed by the BTUs available on the 2 power boil burners. Plenty of sizes available to fit pans of any size. Convection oven cooks evenly with multiple shelves in use. The only...
, This is my first GE range and after searching for a dual fuel with 5 burners, this one has all the components I was looking for. Largest oven capacity, an oven drawer that actually bakes is a plus. Haven't used it yet, but holiday cooking season will...
, I love my new range. Everything I have made using this new appliance has turned out fabulous. The bottom oven has been great for small pans of cookies or reheating casseroles without using the large (it really is large) main oven.
, I saw this stove while searching to buy a new stove with duel fuel (I like an oven with electricity, while having gas on top). After searching for about two weeks I kept coming back to this stove over and over again. I just had to have it. Today it...
, We selected this dual-fuel range with baking drawer to replace a similar one.....two big differences....the GE Cafe has a fifth burner which is very difficult to find on a range this size, and it has a larger oven than our previous dual-fuel range even...
, Bought this range and a companion micro/convection oven as part of our kitchen renovaton. Range works great. easy to use and control. And it looks great too. I recommend the dual-fuel over the gas/gas. Oven i seasy to control for consistent temperature.
, We love the new oven, my wife and I were new to cooking on gas and it is great! The big negative and the reason I did not give it 5/5, is the knobs get way to hot while cooking. If they were plastic they would melt. All the food comes out perfect from...
, The dual fuel concept is very unique and this product is exceptional. This is truly the best of both worlds and a kitchen maven's delight. We are particularly fond of the griddle feature and enjoy pancakes on Sunday morning. If this is your first...
, This stove is absolutely gorgeous and performs great. I will say you must wipe down grates and stainless top to keep it pristine, but this is the case with any appliance you want to keep looking nice. Bottom drawer of stove takes a while to warm up,...
, This is my first gas range ever. After much prodding my daughters, I had a gas line installed and bought this great stove. It is fabulous. I could never simmer on my smooth top and this has such a great simmer and power boil feature. It is very easy to...
, I love this range. It is great at cooking like a chef. And the oven makes the perfect cookies, etc. every time! Plus the extra burner in the middle is perfect for breakfast.
, Love the dual fuel, all the different burners are very nice. We like having the bakind drawer, like a double oven!
, This oven is great. Cooking is very even. The one draw back is cleaning the top surface. The top surface can be easily scratched and care must be taken to use the right products. Clean -up after each use makes it easy. I down graded the appearance...
, The Cafe dual fuel range is a great new addition to our kitchen - along with a matching Spacemaker microwave it couldn't look any better. the functionality of the dual oven is perfect for family dinners, and the additional capacity of the large...
, I couldn't be happier with my GE Cafe range. The dual-fuel feature combining the best of gas stove-top with TWO full-functioning electric ovens has made cooking and baking easier and more fun. I love the center oval-shaped burner for braising and...
, As a special treat to myself, I finally got the gas five burner stove I had been searching for...and did not have to give up the electric ovens I was used to! The increased btu's cook quickly and evenly and the ovens are precise and functionally sized...
, This is a great range, but I can't use the convection feature because the fan hits the metal housing. I have had a GE technician come out and pronounced the problem fixed, but after a week it was still making a banging metal sound. It is very...
, I bought this a year ago and have no problems whatsoever. I agree with other reviews, that the power boil feature is awesome. Can't believe how fast my water boils! The range top is beautiful but does require immediate clean up to keep it looking...
, I have had my range for a year now and I absolutely love it. I live at high elevation and I am finally able to boil water in less than 20 minutes. The power boil burners work really well. Even at 7200 feet I am able to boil water in less than 2...
, I was a little bit hesitant to buy this range because of all the bad reviews before. I have this range for less than a month but I can't find anything wrong with it.(crossing my fingers) I read bad reviews about the loud fan and cheap door knobs before...
, This range after 2 years of use looks as if it is 20 years old. For a stainless range it is cheaply built and despite the looks of a pro range is very poorly built.

, I waited at least 1 yr before buying this stove and I'm glad I did. I believe this is a newer model and many of the negatives that were discussed in previous reviews were fixed. Even consumer reports gave this range good reviews. First of all I love...
, i did extensive research before choosing this gas range, i wanted the pro look without the pro price and i have had several GE gas ranges before and loved the large oven capacity. This oven is great, the chunky knobs and the variety of flames are...

, Unless the oven fan noise is corrected I would not recommend this range. Noise level is totally unacceptable. Stove top is great and like the baking drawer, but the oven fan noise is awful.
, This is really a sharp looking stove. The oven does a great job doing every cooking method we've used. It's easy to program and some complain of the noise from the fan, but we haven't found that bothersome at all. Ours has a soothing soft hum. The...
, I love this range, have used for a few months and so far I'm satisfied.
, We just renovated our kitchen, had a GE profile which was half the price of this oven and we loved it for 9 years, figured how could we go wrong with another GE oven. The fan runs throughout the cooking cycle (and we are not talking convection mode)...
, Purchased this range to replace an existing range in our new home. The old range was an artisy Italian range that was probably purchased by the previous owners for the look versus function. Now, I have the looks and function with my new GE Cafe range....
, I ordered this stove/oven for our cabin. The delivery was 4 hours late (not the ovens fault) so I was unable to try the oven out when it arrived due to needing to return home for kids. I just had the first chance to use it. The burners are nice. The...
, I have been way impressed with my new oven so far. Not only does it look beautiful in my kitchen, but it works fabulously. The power boil feature is wonderful--I can boil things so much faster than before that I have to watch closer to prevent it from...
, I'm happy with the cook top, good heat and even distribution. I haven't tried the griddle or the warming drawer yet. I read plenty of reviews at sites other than GE before purchasing, nobody mentioned the noisy oven fan that runs the entire time oven...
, Had our GE Cafe range installed just under a month cooks great, range heats evenly and oven heats fast. BUT, the exhuast noise from the oven is outrageously noisy. Not necessarily obnoxious but enough to need talk a little louder when its on.
, I looked at a number of alternatives by other manufacturers before settling on the Cafe. Money was not a major consideration, and I could have spent more on others. Had I done so, it would have been for the panache associated with other mabufacturers,...
, I bought this oven hoping to have a useable bottom cooking drawer. It is only good for use as a warmer In addition to being noisy, the fan blows out the burners on one side and makes it difficult to cook meals using both the burners and the oven. The...

, I recently moved out to US from Europe. This fridge is bigger than I am used to but has a great ice maker as standard and the fridge on top which is practical as that is the half used most. I find it strange that the handels are not physically shaped...
, We were used to a bigger side by side refrigerator but we have better access with the single door. It has a good lay out for shelving with quiet a bit of room.

, Excited to have a new, updated refrigerator. Chose the stainless model with bottom freezer. Contents of refrigerator easy to see, eye level. Avoids bending down to reach and guessing where items are. Large crispers with individual controls. Digital...
, Just what we expected from LG. We love the freezer on the bottom. Lots of storage in the frig and freezer. LG has a good reputation from personal experience and from the salesperson.
, I bought this refrigerator last Oct 2010 to replace my fridge that was on it's last legs. It is huge inside, very quiet and I love the bottom freezer. The adjustable shelves on the door and in the fridge really make it easy to put a ton of stuff in...
, Having the fridge portion on top makes it easier to see your fruit & vegetable drawers so they don't go bad. The bottom freezer drawer is an awesome feature. It's not so heavy as a drawer and you can more easily reach the stuff in the back. The...
, We really love this refridgerator! Everyone thinks the refridgerator is much bigger than it is! The look of this fridge is very sleek and the finish is goregous! It is very roomy inside as well.
, We have had this refrigerator for 3 months and are happy with it. This is our first LG product and we are pleased.
, Excellent product, high effectivity (coldness), low noise
, To be perfectly honest we were expecting one with a drawer freezer. But the door is perfectly fine and probably fits better in our space than a drawer would. Plus, this model is way cheaper than the one with the drawer... for whatever reason. Great...
, the primary refridgerator in this house
, The largest bottom freezer that would fit under a cabinet height of 68 inches. I would never buy a side by side again. Although the cu ft is the same this bottom freezer type seems to have twice the amount of space... and you can easily find things....
, perfect item
, I love the refrigerator and it has a lot more space than my old one. If I had to change anything it would be the timing of the door open alarm. I would increase it a little bit since it always sounds when I am putting my groceries away.
, It has tons of space! One minor complaint is that it's a little noisy :(
, I like everything about this product.
, Painless purchase. Knowledgeable sales people made the purchase easy. Fast professional delivery and installation.
, We love the large door, which allows immediate access to anything and everything without searching. We do not use the ice maker, but that is because we never use the ice makers.
, Good storage for dairy products
, great
, The botton freezer refg purchased is used in our home for personal use. The ref being on the top has been a good experience for me and my husband. I have told may of my co workers about this product and have advised them about how great this product...
, This refrigerator offers alot of space that a side by side doesn't. I've really enjoyed it.
, I read some reviews and so far, have to say the following...the icemaker is loud at first when the bin is empty and the ice is hitting the plastic...once a layer of ice is in bin, I barely hear it...a few times I checked to make sure it was actually ma...

, The kids have made messes and spilled things, though it cleans up really well. We also love that the doors open real wide and have not had any problems fitting everything we have wanted to put into it, just fine.

, First refrigerator and will be happy to have this one for a while. Quiet, spacious and awesome having ice maker and filtered cold water.
, When using the ice maker it tends to throw ice out around the cup on to the floor when in crush mode. You should look at improving that. Other than that I really like the unit.
, We owned a simiilar whirlpoolr 25 cu.ft. refrigerator, which had an undershelf tray and a small 1/2 tray at the top level. It seemed more up-scale and was more convenient to store food. It lasted 11 years, and was the reason we replaced it with another...

, Good Price & Good Product, eezer designed to fit full-size pizza boxes
, We went from stainless steel to black... so much easier to keep it shiny.
, This product provide a great performance and it was easy to install
, All and all a great product, it keeps my food cold and my ice cream frozen.
, Overall it's a good refrigerator, the only obvious issue is the compressor. It's loud when the compressor turns on, and off.
, The inside size is a little larger. I really like the shelves with easy height adjustment. The freezer section is well lit. The cycles are quiet.
, This is your average, side by side refrigerator. We have not had any problems with it. I like that the shelves on the door are adjustable.
, Refrigerator works as advertised. Icemaker makes ice. freeze keeps stuff frozen.
, OUR LAST UNIT Was a Whirlpool it was 20 or 25 years old. It became very loud as it got older. This new unit I love for you do not hear it. at first I had to get up at night to see if it was working. To me this is the best quality.
, This fridge has been mostly really great. Nice design, easy to use and clean. I've had this fridge for about two years and I had no problems until a couple of months ago when it just stopped cooling out of nowhere. The repair person said that it was du...
, This is a fine product, we have had no problems yet.
, I like the adjustable shelves in my refrigerator. It helps to be able to adjust with the wide range of options that this one offers.
, It is not a fancy frig, could use another drawer, but has plenty of space and good door storage. The only negative is that the ice dispenser is really noisy.
, After one rejected product, different model, Goerge Koryta found exactly what we wanted and shipped it.  No sales tax.  No delivery.  Product showed up on time.
, Refrigerator we wanted turned out to be a 2012 model, but George Koryta kept looking until he found it.  Local installation was a hassle, but the price, shipping and white-glove delivery could not have been better.
, The Whirlpool side by side refrigerator was the perfect choice. I needed to replace a 20year old energy guzzling refrigerator in a limited space. It has worked out perfectly
, Love my new fridge. Only wish it had a deli drawer and ice maker is a little loud.
, This side by side refrigerator has plenty of storage space on the shelves and the doors have plenty of room for large items.
, This Whirlpool product is spacious, easy to clean and has great features.
, Making a large appliance purchase now that we are retired and on a fixed income was one made only after researching all I could. In the end no one could match these features at the price I paid. We love it! Thanks to the convenience of the in the door ...
, I chose this model for the reviews about it and the price. The unit works great, food stays fresh, and the ice freezes really hard. The water tastes really good, a lot better quality then the tap water I get. It takes a little time to get use to the no...
, The product works well. Doesn't have the bells and whistles you may be looking for, but it keeps track of your water filter and it is very cold. Sometimes less is more. In this case it is.
, We've had this fridge for almost a year. We're a family of 8 and this fridge works well and we've had no problems. I like that you can get ice and water at the same time. It makes a LOT of ice and is easy to clean. It has great freezer storage. The...
, Owned this for a year, mechanically fine but the finish is poor. Any dirt that gets on it is there permanently. I cannot clean this fridge. So, I would suggest anything other than a white whirlpool fridge unless you live in a barn then you`re ok....

, I use this in my kitchen. I have a frezer in the garage.After having a refrigerator where the ice and water feature were not working for five years , I am enjoying that feature in the new refrigerator very much
, It's a pretty nice fridge except for the high pitched noise it emits while running.
, Our old fridge had been loping along for months. No ice maker. Beach water had to be filtered at the kitchen sink, difficult to use, especially by children, and not very tasty. The cooks in our family range from Gourmet to Avid, and having fresh, cold...
, I like it, just needs another shelf, and small bin.
, This is our primary refrigerator/freezer and is just the right size both internally and externally for our family and kitchen sizes.
, is quiet
, Great product for the price. The folks in store were polite respectful and very helpful as always
, Not even a year into our purchase one of the drawers broke. This year the ice container cracked and no longer holds the ice, I now have to purchase a replacement for it. This will be my last whirlpool purchase ever.
, Very happy with appliance. Great size and fit for our family
, Used 24 hours a day and very happy with it so far
, It's great, perfect for a couple or a small family.
, This was a great deal for the price. Wish the freezer side was larger.
, Bought this product almost a year ago and have had no problems with it so far. Has lots of room and the external ice and water dispenser is great. I only wish the small red leds were a little brighter. Would buy this product again.

, Excellent appearance, good product value for cost,
, Not so fancy that I'm afraid I'll break it but all of the ammenities I want in a new refrigerator. Pull out shelves which are easy to clean. Water and ice dispenser (a relatively quiet ice maker) are an added bonus too.

, Have always liked Whirlpool, however , I will not recommend this refridgerator. It is very loud and always seems to be running. Poor performance.
, I have had the service people out about six times to correct air leaking into the freezer and forming ice crystals on top of the freezer. This unit is only six months old and we had this problem from the beginning.
, Not even a year into our purchase one of the drawers broke. This year the ice container cracked and no longer holds the ice, I now have to purchase a replacement for it. This will be my last whirlpool purchase ever.

, This unit serves it's purpuse very well. IT HAS BEEN DEPENDABLE.

, I like my new microwave. It cooks quickly and heats more completely than my old one. It is nice looking and easy to use. My one complaint is that the door is very noisy to close. Was not difficult to install and so far I am very happy with it.
, Have white version and it looks nice. Would buy again and recommend for those seeking functionality versus looks.
, I installed this unit myself using templates provided. It was clearly a case of measure twice drill once in order to get it level and exactly at the right height.
, overall I am satisfied with the product just do not like the finishe signal it is not necessary to sound OFF 3 times
, great microwave for the price with easy installation. will recommend to family and friends.
, Easy to install, has great features, looks of quality. The door has to be forced open and slammed shut.
, Sleek no handle front makes for easy cleaning. Glass shelves make finding items easy.
, happy with purchase ,good value for product purchased .product was open box item but in good condition
, Easy to use and basic design but works great. Big enough inside with turn table.
, The microwave works well as a microwave. The reason I purchased an over-the-range microwave was to save counter space and make use of over-the-range dead space. This microwave boasts a 300CFM vent to ventilate the range. However, I find that it...
, Works well and is easy to use. One downside is that you can't turn off turntable. Looks great in our updated kitchen.
, Great product, looks good & performs well. The only knock is the timer, it works but it beeps so quietly you can't hear it. The beep for the microwave is loud & continuous but the timer not so much. $5 timer from Walmart fixes this problem though.
, This microwave is attractive and heats food as intended. My only gripe is that it is loud at all the wrong times. When something is finished cooking the microwave beeps LOUDLY. When you open the door it does NOT STOP beeping. The only way (I have...
, I have only had this microwave for a couple of weeks so I can't speak to longevity. But it cooks well and has all of the features that I need. No complaints at all.
, This microwave seems (after 1 month) to be a very good basic model. We selected it based on the Frigidaire brand's good rating in Consumer Reports (low numbers of repairs reported), and the similarity of the model number to one of their top rated...
, I am very happy with this microwave! I am what I would consider a basic cook so I like the controls to be simple and concise. My family of four had no issue using it right away,the functions are very clear. The styling is also important to me--I do...
, It is simple to use and I'm would reconmend it to all my friends
, My first one lasted 7 years in my new house it worked well for my family so whn it went out I replaced it with the same one.
, I purchased this microwave because it had no middle rack. It was one of the few models available that did not have the middle rack, which for the life of me, I can't believe that's the new style now. Who needs to clean around those rack holders. Bad...

The convection oven is awesome.
, This oven cooks very fast. Water boils in no time due to the super burner. I especially love the center burner for using my griddle and grill pans. I havent used the convection oven yet but will soon as a receipe calls for one.
, I had a GE Profile gas range before, but the quality of the materials were cheap and components of the range started to wear off or break apart. This range is so much better. As someone who cooks often, I need a reliable and sturdy range. This is defin...
, I love the style and stove top functions. he oven is large and bakes well.
, Cooks and bakes evenly. Food never gets dried out and the convection feature makes cooking faster and easier.
, This range has many great features for the price. The middle burner can be used with the stove grates aor the large griddle.
, I really like this range. The convection is amazing! The only problem I had with it was that it came dented the first two times and needed to be replaced. Once that was straightened out and I started using it, I found it to be a great range. Also, all ...
, I love my new stove! Wish the griddle came with it, was told it was easy to get one, and it wasn't. I can now boil water much quicker! Having the different powered burners is perfect. No more burnt cookies!
, Our new GE stove was a big purchase for us so there were correspondingly high expectations. After seven months of use, I can say that the stove has performed beautifully and we are very happy with it. The range of burners is great, so you can simmer or...
, really nice burners... cooks evenly.. setting baking time is great.. no more pushing the button multiple times to get the right temperture.. just put the time in and start... last, the convection is great.. the only complaint.. it did not come with a g...
, This stove is the second worst range I have ever owned. The burners heat unevenly and can't seem to be adjusted properly, ie, one side burns hotter than the other on the four main burners creating random hot spots. If they were all on the same side it ...
, We recently converted to natural gas and purchased this range. There are just a few minor things that I would like to see changed. The center burner should come with the griddle. The front turbo burner needs to be modified. When using turbo mode on a m...
, Good cooktop burner assortment, convection oven is the only way to go.
, My time in the kitchen is more enjoyable and efficient with five burners sized for different tasks. I can easily multitask to get the job done.
, I am very pleased with the looks and durability of this stove. It is easy to surface clean and the time bake feature worked as expected.
, The range's appearance has grown on me and I especially like the different-sized stove-top burners -- the small one is ideal for brewing a cup of coffee. The electronics on the rear of the stove helps keep our children's hands away -- they loved using ...
, Simple but efficient and serviceable design and function. I bought the center grill to cover the center burner for a work space on the range. A knob often turns a bit when I lean against the oven (I am short) to reach pots in the back, which may releas...
, This is Great Sove and Oven. I love the performance and the looks of this unit. I only wish the center oval burner was larger and had more BYU's I would highly recommend this unit.

, This range is easy to use and clean. One of the burner has 17000 BTU that make the cooking more efficient to cook.
, Every feature of this stove is terrific except the oblong center burner. The main reason I wanted that was so I can sear a good steak on my cast iron griddle. But it has a flame so low you can barely use it to keep things warm, let alone sear them....
, Nice looking range for a good price. I especially like the 17k BTU burner for quick boiling of water and the fifth burner. I also like the cast iron grid.
, We are very happy with our choice to go with this oven. It has been a pleasure to use and we have not had any issues whatsoever with it in the 8 months that we have had it. We love the convenience of having the entire top of the range as a work space,...
, This is a great buy for the money. It has excellent features, a great look and cooks like a commercial unit.
, this is the best stove i ever had. it cooks so evenly.
, We built a new house and did research on GE appliances. We knew we wanted a gas stove and feel in love with this brand! We truly enjoy cooking in this gas stove with the convection feature! Would recommend this stove!
, I purchased this stove a few weeks ago and have been baking everyday since!! I have 2 young children and no time to bake/cook. But since buying this stove I have found myself baking and cooking each day. The time to cook and bake with my new stove is...
, We've had this stove for over a month now and really enjoy cooking on it. Very easy to keep clean which is important since I have kids just learning to cook.

, A great GE range. The price was right, along with the discount made it a great buy.
, My biggest concern was that i paid for installation but the stove wasn't installed I had to do it myself.
, Overall a very good product oven is very nice and the burners are all very efficant except for the center oval burner is not very powerfull and the control knobs for the burners are very sensitive to the touch.
, I love this oven! It is beautiful, like other reviewers, the digital area feels a little generic, hope it stands the test of time! I love how it cooks! Grates are heavy cast and really look fantastic. Middle burner is just fine for cooking as well has ...
, This oven looks great in my kitchen. I wasn't really into the stainless steel look initially but it has really grown on me. The only thing with the the black cooktop is it does show dust/crumbs but not the cooked on stains that you see with a lighter t...

, Oven is fine, but the measurements are wrong because the top is beveled, we had to recut our granite for it to fit in the space of our old oven.
, We ordered this gas range from Best Buy, it was on sale. It arrived on time and the delivery people were nice and responded to all my questions. We are very satisfied with our new stainless steel stove, it looks very elegant and has all the right burne...
, Please see muy notes on the refrid delevery as this is the same, the company damaged many things in my house
, The middle bruner is great from anything to gravy to omelets
, I was very surprised that the broiler was not included with this stove.  I have never had a stove where the broiler was an additional purchase.
, It boils quickly....easy to keep clean.
, Bought it for the middle griddle and just love it. Power burner is really quick I w2asn't too confident it would work as quick as advertised BUT it does, it takes no time to boil cool water

, I absolutely love the pedestals that lift my washer and dryer up and provide storage areas but I do wish it was about 1 or 2 inches taller so that the large detergent bottles would fit standing upright.

, This is a must have if you aren't a fan of bending over to get your laundry. Highly recommended
, The pedestal looks good and is a very practical storage addition plus it elevates the unit which makes it easier to load and unload.
, This pedestal works well with the washer and the size of the drawer is better than the Samsung model that I last had. It would be nice if pedestals were generic so they did not have to be replaced when a washer is replaced but I am sure that would ne...
, I got my pedestals at a great deal of buy one get one free! They have a lot of storage room for items like dryer sheets, color catcher sheets, my iron, and a great place to keep the manuals for my washer and dryer. I am really happy to have them!
, Works great I like that the doors are higher. They are not used for storage to often
, Places Washer/Dryer at a perfect height. Storage is good, but lacks the height for a large detergent bottle. While a bit overpriced, I think they were worth the purchase.
, This is a must for the washer and dryer and very handy storage. It seems very pricey for what you get.
, I bought the LG washer/dryer on sale and lucked into the pedestals being on sale too. They raise the units up higher off the ground which helps me tremendously because I'm tall. They also look beautiful. The pedestals have storage available inside...
, This drawer provides a nice way to organize your detergent and laundry accessories. I wasn't exprcting the drawer to be divided in 2 down the middle but that was a pleasant surprise. It also gives good height to the front load machine as well so you...
, This pedestal is a must, otherwise plan on working on your knees.
, Pretty sturdy but drawers are lightweight for the price.
, Very nice and useful laundry pedestral but a bit too expensive.
, Absolute must if you have front-loaders; the storage pedestals give so much more to the overall functionality. I can literally put over 2 cabinets full of cleaning/laundry supplies in one pedestal!
, I was somewhat disappointed in the pedestals,(I have two now) my thought when I bought them was not only to bring the laundry pair up from floor level, but the storage was important. But the larger size products will not fit, nor will the larger...
, You need the pedestals if you don't stack the washer and dryer. This raises them to a more manageable height. I do wish they were included with the washer and dryer.
, The pedestal makes loading and unloading the washer and dryer so much easier. It also has a lot of usable space in the drawer. I love the looks of the washer/dryer with the pedestals under them.
, Product is very well made and sturdier than you'd expect. It does 2 things: raises w/d and provides drawer space. Need to weigh whether that is worth $500 price-tag (for 2). Drawer is split into 2 sections which is nice. Was able to install DIY within...

, Glad I purchased the pair. Will always have them. Makes doing laundry easier.
, pedestal is a must, especially if you are tall ... only one drawer divider
, These are awesome for those with back problems. Wish the price was cheaper.
, These pedistals are back savers, lift the units about 15 inches higher making it much better to work with. I was surprised with what I was able to fit into the drawer. I think it makes the washer/dryer look much more sleek
, Love the height of this pedestal and roominess. Great addition to the LG washer
, Big and deep .easy to open. They fit perfectly under the wash and dryer. Goog for storing laundry products.
, This drawer/stand put te dryer at the right height and has plenty of storage area.
, You would never know this was refurbished. It was wrapped in plastic and looked brand new! DO NOT waste your money buying a new one anywhere else! There was not a scratch, dent, or paint chip anywhere on this. It was in perfect condition! I'm such a h...
, We ordered two of these to go under our newly installed LG washer/dryer. One had a few scratches on the front and the second one was quite dented and scratched on the bottom. So remember they are refurbished. The extremely difficult part was getting ...
, I am normally stay away from anything that says (Refurbished) but at the price i had to buy these and I am glad I did. They are in perfect condition. In the big box stores these cost $.00 plus tax and shipping. Save your self some money. Buy them he...
, Put the pedestal in place and leveled it and when you lift the washer in place it is level also. Great storage for detergents and softener. The is a 14 safety net in case of flooding downstairs. - How did the color on site compare with the actual prod...
, This product puts the washer up higher so we don't have to stoop down to use the washer. The drawer is good for storage.
, This pedestal is a must, otherwise plan on working on your knees.
, You need the pedestals if you don't stack the washer and dryer. This raises them to a more manageable height. I do wish they were included with the washer and dryer.
, Pretty sturdy but drawers are lightweight for the price.
, This drawer provides a nice way to organize your detergent and laundry accessories. I wasn't exprcting the drawer to be divided in 2 down the middle but that was a pleasant surprise. It also gives good height to the front load machine as well so you...
, Very nice and useful laundry pedestral but a bit too expensive.
, Absolute must if you have front-loaders; the storage pedestals give so much more to the overall functionality. I can literally put over 2 cabinets full of cleaning/laundry supplies in one pedestal!
, I was somewhat disappointed in the pedestals,(I have two now) my thought when I bought them was not only to bring the laundry pair up from floor level, but the storage was important. But the larger size products will not fit, nor will the larger...
, The pedestal makes loading and unloading the washer and dryer so much easier. It also has a lot of usable space in the drawer. I love the looks of the washer/dryer with the pedestals under them.
, Product is very well made and sturdier than you'd expect. It does 2 things: raises w/d and provides drawer space. Need to weigh whether that is worth $500 price-tag (for 2). Drawer is split into 2 sections which is nice. Was able to install DIY within...
, I bought the LG washer/dryer on sale and lucked into the pedestals being on sale too. They raise the units up higher off the ground which helps me tremendously because I'm tall. They also look beautiful. The pedestals have storage available inside...
, I couldn't see spending an additional $250/each for these pedestals...so glad I checked here on Overstock! Only white was available so my husband spray painted them red to match our new washer/dryer. They look perfect. I'm very happy to have saved...
, What a great price. Looked all over for one and the cheapest was over twice the price. It arrived promptly. No assembly was required. We popped the dryer on top and that was it! Very satisfied. - How did the color on site compare with the actual...
, I did not to spend the $$$ on the ones from the retailer so when I did a little and these popped up it was like a dream come true! They are perfect in ever way and look brand new! I couldn't believe they were refurbished. I saved alot on these! Thank...
, I ordered 2 pedestals and they were basically in new condition with only minor scratches, etc. For the price, you can't beat this compared to what they sell for new. The problem was that installation hardware was not included and, at least initially,...
, LOVE these. As a 6'4 man who spends much of his life ducking and bending what a pleasure to stand up straight to do laundry. More storage space too! - How did the color on site compare with the actual product? Perfect - Please tell us about the...
, I ordered two, one for my washer and dryer. There was only one in stock, so I had to place an order for one, then had o.com email me when it came back in stock. The first one I received was flawless, looked brand new. The second one had a small ~3...
, Wy wife and I had been wanting to purchase these pedestals for a while but cringed at the box store price for what appeared to be little more than a metal box. Given the price of these refurbished ones we bit the bullet. Having the extra height made...
, The pedestals came fast, within 2 days of placing my order. One was perfect. One had chipped paint on the front of the drawer, so I sent an email to Overstock and they sent a new drawer front to me within a few days, no return required. Overstock is...
, Items were received as described. One looked 100% brand new, one had a 2-3 inch scratch on the side which is totally hidden from view anyway. I matched these to a 4 year old LG washer/dryer set we purchased but didn't want to cough up anhother $500...
, I am very happy with my purchase and LOVE my washer and dryer lifted up higher by the use of these pedestals. - How did the color on site compare with the actual product? Product was white, which matched site color. - Please tell us about the quality...
, Picked these up to match our new LG washer/dryer set. One drawer was perfectly repainted and looked new. The other had a small vertical crease in the front but not easy to see; it also had been repainted white since i could see the faint red color when...
, This pedestal was easy to install and fit my washer perfectly. The price was right, where I didn't have to pay full price, and the unit works great! - How did the color on site compare with the actual product? perfect - Please tell us about the...
, This was a great deal. Wife keep pressing me to get this but I just couldn't see myself dropping $600 for new ones. These are pretty much new and match my units perfectly. One of them had minor damage in the back. Nothing visible. Install was a...

, I am pleased with the pedestal and the quality. It is at least a two person, if not three person job to fit the pedestal to the dryer. There are instructions on top of the pedestal that only go so far, you need to read the instructions that are inside...
, So glad to find these pedestals at a much better price then in the stores. I used my washer and dryer for about a year before buying these pedestals. Boy, does it make a difference!! I also love the big drawers. - How did the color on site compare with...
, Great product! I saved a lot compared to buying a new one. I wouldn't have checked to see if it was repainted as claimed by some reviews here. Overall, I do not have any regrets of buying this product and I strongly recommend it especially because of...
, I love having my front loading LG washer and dryer elevated an extra 14 inches. It is much easier on my back to load and unload them. The refurbished pedestals appear brand new, work perfectly and were easily installed. They were a great value at...
, this pedestal is a good buy. it was just like new. saw some for sale all banged up for more money at sites like ebay. packaging was beat up, but the pedestal was unharmed. bought for an LG dryer. - How did the color on site compare with the actual...
, Don't know why anyone would purchase a pedestal at regular price. These say that they are refurbished but I could not tell the difference. They look identical to the new ones. The color was a perfect match and it came with all the necessary...
, i would reccoment this to anyone! the product is bran new ! color is right on, i got them at an amazing price and shipping was lightening speed! props to overstock! - How did the color on site compare with the actual product? right on - Please tell us...
, I purchased two pedestals for a washer and dryer we bought a few years ago. They fit the older style with an additional part, easily ordered for the washer only. The extra height makes it so much easier to put clothes in and out of the washer and...
, Purchase 2 of the pedestals. One came in badly damaged heavy cardboard box. Pedestal inside had a significant dent, so I called customer service and they gave me a $$$ discount, which was OK with. However, only one of the boxes contained the...

, These pedestals arrived in great condition. Were I not told they were refurbished, the packaging would have been the only tip off that they were not brand new. Washer and dryer both mounted with no difficulty at all, and balancing/leveling them was a...
, Good as new but with a nice discount. They do raise the appliances up quite a bit. Beware if you're on the shorter side and store things in a cabinet behind the appliances, you may have reaching things. Otherwise its a back saver. - How did the color...
, I am pleased with the refurbished pedestals for my front loading washer & dryer. You would never know they were not brand new. - How did the color on site compare with the actual product? matched - Please tell us about the quality of the product....
, So happy I saved over $100.00 on stands/storage units for my washer and dryer. They were refurbished, but perfect in every way. Roomy draws for your washing/cleaning supplies. The only thing is all the bottles are laying down. The units aren't deep...
, Although identified as 'refurbished' the quality is like new. In fact, I order two NEW from another website and returned one due to damage during shipping. Compared the item I purchased from 'O' to the other new one I had and it was basically the...
, After having owned our LG WD for a year and a half, (and after having owned another front load pair for 9 years), I finally decided to get pedestals. I was ecstatic when I found these on Overstock. Had to wait a while until my color (graphite) was in...
, Why spend over $229 retail, when you can get the same item for $169 & get free shipping? I had resigned myself that if there were a ding or scratch, why would I care, it's in the laundry room, but this item is in 100% perfect condition. Although...
, The pedestals worked great! They were easy to use with my new LG washer/dryers. I highly recommend them as you no longer have to bend over to put loads in the washer / dryer. - How did the color on site compare with the actual product? It was white as...
, To soon to review. It's empty @ this time. Ask me in a few months or a year from now.
, I love the extra space; hide my laundry soap, etc from view. Love that it raises the washer/dryer to eye level for me.
, I was a little worried about the materials from which the pedestals were made but they appear to strong and sturdy enough to support the weight of the washer and dryer. They don't vibrate or walk across the room during the spin cycles or fast tumbling ...
, storage
, I like the fact that the washer and dryer are lifted off the floor; however now. Because of the placement of my machines (dryer on left, washer on right), I still need to put the laundry into a basket then into the dryer. In my opinion, they don't warr...
, great additon for my washer and dryer for extra storage space
, We had a 9 high pedestal for our LG Washer and Dryer as that is all that was offered when we originally purchased our units. We thought it would be so nice to have a higher pedestal to save our backs when loading and unloading clothes. The price was e...

I also like the musical chime it plays to signal the end of the cycle. What I don't like is how it vibrates and shakes very loudly.
, good product easy to install east to use well made nice color
, Awesome looking washer that does the job right. No old front loader issues (smells, water collection,etc...). The product has a small catch that keeps the door open a small amount for ventilation. More wash cycle options than I know what to do with! Ef...
, My new washer - the LG - 4.0 Cu. Ft. 12-Cycle High-Efficiency Steam Front-Loading Washer (Graphite Steel) - has been the best washer I've bought and used thus far. It uses half the water and takes half the time to do laundry compared to a similar front...
, Nice washer-but- unit would shake rooms on same side of home.  They sent a tech out to check it was level, but did not solve shaking the home.  Unit is large, very quiet, cleans great, but would not recommend unless on concrete.  They did replace with ...
, Runs great. No issues with it. Very quiet machine.
, Would highly recommend this washer and dryer to anyone wanting a front load washer and dryer.
, Can't say anything bad about this washer, its just amazing. Do not hesitate to purchase this for a second!
, I bought this washer with the matching dryer a couple of months ago. I struggled with the purchase of these machines because of the expense but I was replacing my broken washer and had no choice. I researched a great deal on the internet, salesmen, ser...
, glad bought a LG washer, low price, quiet, clean clothes
, This machine compliments the renovation of my laundry room beautifully. It's easy to operate - just choose the type of clothes you put it, press the button, and it does the rest for you.
, I was hesitant to spend such a pretty penny but after three years of researching on settled on this!!!! Am I glad that I did!!! IT IS AMAZING!!
, I like the steam feature. The chimes are fun. Works very well.
, The first washing machine that I bought, I loved the steam cycle knowing that everything will get sanitized but gently. It is pretty quiet too, sometimes I feel like checking on it, thinking that it might have stopped in the middle of the cycle but act...
, We were a little nervous about going to a front load machine from conventional ones, but this machine has changed our minds. Our clothes come out cleaner than ever before. Not to mention the look cool in our laundry room!
, Have had machine for approx 1 month now with no issues at all. Both washer and dryer are on pedestals which makes loading and unloading easy. Machine is easy to use and as previous owners have stated: wipe down door and inside rubber seal after each wa...
, I love our new purchase of the LG front load washer. It is easy to operate, very quiet, uses less water & detergent, and has so many great options to use.
, I replaced my older front load machine with this one and it has been great. All the different options make doing laundry a piece of cake. My 10 year old son even does his own laundry now.

, We purchased the pair of these about one month ago. They are absolutely the best washer and dryer on the market. We should have bought these months ago. LG stands behind their product when the washer arrived two days later the door started to leak and ...
, This is the first LG appliance that we bought and the style and design was the first thing that caught our eyes. I am amazed with the technology features it has compared to our previous washer. The ease of use, quiet performance and the substantial sav...

, We are very happy with the new LG Washer. We bought top of the line and it has lived up to every expectation and more. The Steam cycle is a terrific addition to the process of making sure everything is clean as can be and still handled with gentle resp...
, Washer has a lot of great features, but I rarley use them. I love the washer, but wish I had chosen a less expensive washer with fewer features. I have not had any problems with the washer.
, I can't compare this to other front-loaders since it's our first one. We bought it based on the Consumer Reports reviews. It seems fine after two months: quiet, quicker to wash than I expected, and does a good job cleaning. Is it quieter than others? I...
, A fantastic washer with a variety of useful settings. We have a newborn and this appliance has been superb in getting rid of various stains. The machine is very quiet as well.
, This washer has superior features offering the latest in technology and energy-saving features. Cycles are shorter, and clothes are cleaner. Easy and quick to operate. Very user friendly.
, quiet, efficient, easy to use. water and electric bills have gone down, clothes are cleaner, and using less detergent. HIGHLY recommend this product.
, I have had this washer for a little more than a month and like it a lot. The one drawback is the vibration I am experiencing with the spin cycle. I also at times get a water hammer noise. I will call service soon to see if these problems can be solved,...

, This washer makes doing laundry fun. It is every easy to use even though there are a lot if options. I really enjoy the sound it makes when you turn it on. I am constantly amazed how much I can wash in one load. I am so very happy with this washing mac...
, This unit oerall is great, the only downfall is: to prevent a musty spell, it is required to wipe the rubber seal and wipe the inside door after every use. For the price that you are paying for, you would think a better solution would have been developed.
, We have used our LG washer for about a month now and are very pleased. It does a very good job getting the clothes clean. We are still exploring all of the cycles and there seems to be one for everything. It is quiet and is of good quality. We would de...

, This washing machine is the nicest one that we have ever owned and probably has more options than we will ever need to use! We installed it ourselves and it was a very simple process. We also love the way it looks. After looking at several other washin...
, Bought my new LG around Thanksgiving 2012. Love how much less water it uses compared to my old top loader; while still cleaning the clothes just as well, if not better. Love the large capacity. A king size comforter will fit, but would do better in the...

, So much research to decide on a front loader but now I'm convinced they're the best. Love the LG and have finally figured out the majority of programs available after 4 months. This baby averages 1-3 loads a day, every day, and cleans them all wonderfu...

, I got it 2 months ago and so far it is working great. Very easy to use and conserves a lot of water compared t my older machine
, Overall, a great washing machine. Only downfall is that we noticed it was vibrating quite a bit on the pedestal. I had to buy anti-vibration pads to make it stop.
, I purchased a top load high efficiency washer and ended up taking it back because the clothes didn't even get wet until the rinse cycle. I bought this front loader with pedestal and the results have been amazing. The only problem I have with the new on...
, I love my new washer. It looks absolutely beautiful and has wonderful features. Unfortunately, I do not take advantage of all the features. It is great that the clothes come out so dry. It certainly cuts down on the time to dry when hanging outside or ...

, Our family of four (going on five) love this machine. It handles large loads of cotton laundry and small loads of delicates with equal care and effect. My favorite shortcut is to load it up with normal wash, turn it on and press start. No need to set a...

, enjoy features, efficiency and cost savings. first purchase of an lg product.
, Love the steam and Turbo wash. Don't like the tray where I add the liquid bleach and soap. I have to pour the liquid bleach in a cup then add to the tray because it otherwise comes out of the bottle and goes all over the floor because of the way I have...
, This washer cleans well. My whites are very white. I used bleach and washer detergent before in the older washer, but it never came out this clean. It is quiet and it seems reliable. (At least the consumer report says so. Which is the main reason why I...
, We wanted a washer with steam, and this one is so worth it. The selection of wash options are not only numerous but useful. Washer is quiet. Handles the largest loads! And clothes come out much cleaner than previous front load. Would highly recommend.
, Simply stated, items I thought were stained came clean after years of washing! Who knew that my previous front loader wasn't up to snuff.
, Easy to use. And does so much more than my last washer. We have gone from a 2.6 cu ft to this one and have cust our loads down to less than 1/2. Steam cycles and fresh care take a lot more time but other than that 2 thumbs up!!
, This is my first machine that I have ever owned but due to apartment/condo living far from the first machine I have every used. For someone that has pets, children this machine is magic for what it can do and the piece of mind you get when stick rather...
, The washer is solid, great design, durable and user controls are easy to navigate. Overall i like the washer. I purchased the metal braided water lines and found that they jerk severely when the tub is fulling. The washer doesn't just fill the tub, it ...
, This washer would receive a higher rating of the benefits of a large capacity washer could be utilized. My previous front loading washer had a smaller capacity but cold handle significantly larger loads flawlessly. One would think that buying a larger ...
, I love this washer & the dryer that matches. For the value you can't beat it. I highly recommend the base drawer only to make the appliances more ergonomic for loading and unloading. If we didn't have those, the machines would be to short for me (I'm t...
, This washer works well and I have had no issues with it. My only complaint at all would be that when it begins a wash cycle it is a bit noisy while it adjusts to the load size, but the majority of the cycles are very quiet. The clothes and other washab...
, Amazing how good a new washer and dryer can be (we also got the matching electric dryer). Extremely quiet and fast. Huge number of settings. Spins so fast that there's little water left for the dryer, which then runs for much less time than our old one...

, We had a Kenmore front loader that took forever to wash a load of clothes. This LG is so fast, plus it has a Turbo setting. When it's done it will play a nice melody. We love this washer!
, This washer has multiple settings for all types of clothes and all types of cleaning. The finish is gorgeous and is a nice piece of furniture in my downstairs laundry/bathroom. Clothes are minimally wet at the end of the cycle which decreases drying ti...
, Overall I like it but its pretty pricey. I dont like not being able to choose water levels. There are many cycles and each one only allows you to choose certain speeds and water temps. I would rather be able to choose whatever temp or speed I wanted ra...

, My wife and have moved several times in the last few years. This is the 4th time we have puirchased this same washer. We have one in a rental home, 1 in our daughters home, 1 sold with the last house and this one in our new home. We also have the match...

, Great washer. Very easy to use, high efficiency. A little bit expensive. Does not vibrate my house.
, The quick closing solenoid valves for this machine are hard on our pipes creating a water hammer issue; we've installed residential style water hammer arresters that don't do much to help resolve this. It's a great machine and I'd recommend it, the onl...
, This was a massive upgrade over my 8 year old top loading washer. Having the multiple options helps with all the different types of clothes my wife and I wash.
, I purchased this product because my old washer was on its last leg. I was a little nervous because this is kind of high tech. After reading the manual I made my own setting that I use most. This has saved me a lot of money inthe short time I have had i...
, I love this machine. Whats great about it is that there are so many different settings that you can wash pretty much anything and be confident your clothes will look great and not be ruined or faded. It is super fast, I've noticed that it cleans the cl...
, Ok, so I didn't think I'd be so thrilled that I'd actually be writing a review for a washer, but, nonetheless, here it is! This is the first front load washer I've owned and I can say that I will never go back to a top load again. The short list consis...
, 5 stars! LG makes a great product! Love all the cycles available!

, Much quicker than my older front load, clothes are clean and well spun out. Have used only about 1/2 of the cycles, those are great. Love having the washer on a pedestal; would never go back to having washer directly on the floor.
, You can't find a better washing machine that does as outstanding a job as this unit does for the money. Oh! did I mention it also cleans with Steam!! That means your kid's stuffed animals can be washed without clumping or ruining them. LG you rock!
, IT DOES THE JOB AND THEN SOME AND IS WHISPER QUIET
, I had an old small top load washer and hated doing wash, but now I don't mind at all! My clothes are cleaner and I do a lot more laundry in a very short time with a variety of choices to clean them. I can also now wash my comforter!!!! I have cats and ...

, I have used this item only a few times so far, and I am very happy with the performance. It comes with some accessories, so you can do some chopping/grinding as well as immersion blending. Just to be brief, it's very effective for it's purpose(s) and I...
, This is a great product for any household. It has many uses and is very easy to go from one to another. I have already recommended this product to some of my friends. I love the ability to go from chopping to mixing in just a push of a button. I sugges...
, I've had several stick blenders over the years but this one is the best by far. I like that it comes apart for cleaning and has such a strong motor. The whisk attachment is the best thing if you are scrambling eggs or making a small amount of whipped c...
, Works extremely well and gets the job done:) easy to use, practical and easy to clean
, PROS - Well built, quiet motor, extra attachements are a bonus. 3 year factory warranrty. Great Value. CONS - Have not found any.
, i wish this has a speed setting rather than just a pulse action blending. easy to use and wash. the head is stainless steel but the body is made of plastic so don't expect a complete stainless steel product. so far it is great for making smoothies and...
, Very happy with product
, I have been looking for an stick blender for about 3 months. Great price and fast shipping.
, I received this for my birthday in April. I can tell you that this is the best one I have used so far. I really enjoy making milkshakes with this. I also chop all of my vegetables, and fruits for some awesome smoothies!! :-))))))) MMMMMGOOD. I highly...
, We got this as a wedding gift. I love it! I have used it for blending smoothies, juices,soups. I love the chopper attachment which I have used for nuts and graham crackers. I have a brand new top of the line kitchen aid food processor and I find myself...
, I thought I'd only use an immersion blender for soups, but then I saw this blender/food processor with the whisk attachment as well. I use the whisk attachment for making whipped cream - so much easier than using my stand mixer. I use the food...
, LOVED this mixer until the blade snapped off. I used it to mix a pitcher of formula everyday for my twins but attempted to make a protein shake for myself with crushed ice and the blades snapped off. Currently using my parents' mixer (same one) but...
, I -love- this product. It has three products in one - stick blender, mini-cuisinart food processor, and electric whisk. It is small and manageable to use and store, which is necessary in my tiny kitchen. While I have only owned the product for a few...
, I use this product almost everyday. Instead of taking out a cutting board or a large food processor, this is so easy and convenient to use. It is small and easy to clean. It is convenient for soups, salsas, liquids, or anytime u need to get things...
, My friend recommended getting a hand held blender for cooking and baking. She kept singing praises especially for her Cuisinart Blender which she has had for over 10 years! So, I got online and reviewed different blenders to compare price, features...
, This item was on our wedding registry - and was almost the first item we received from a very thoughtful friend! It's been a great appliance to have in the kitchen. Since the CSB-77 comes with several attachments, I will review them separately:...
, Love the mixer, very easy to make vitamins drinks in the morning and easy to clean. The Chop part is a bit small and I found it very difficult to clean.
, I love this product! It is so practical and easy to use, very handy. I have other Cuisianart products but not in a blender/food processor. The SmartStick is more powerful than my food processor.
, This is a wonderful product and helps with all kinds of menu items. I bought it for soup and so far it has been great with blending soups to a smooth mixture. I am sure the other uses will be helpful as well. I hightly recommend this item.
, The wisk attachment is not what you think, flings mixture everywhere no matter how large a bowl you use. The plastic teeth on the gear that connect to the chopper & blender wear down fast, rendering them useless.
, I absolutely love this kitchen appliance! Never have I owned a stick blender before, and cant believe how many times we now reach for it. In fact Sweetie used it most everyday many times making fruit slushes with splenda. A treat for diabetics! No...
, I LOVE IT,it made cooking lintel soup a piece of cake.
, Cuisinart makes great kitchen products and the Hand Blender, SmartStick upholds the reputation. I can easily make about 1/2 cup of Pesto.The blade is low enough that it gets all the basil chopped. The power stick disconnects with one button so you can...
, I really liked my Smart Stick but the motor gets weak after about three years. I have had two of them thinking the first one was just weak but after the second time I give up on them. Warranty no good after three years.
, This is a quick way to make cream soups...........so much better than using a blender.No more mess or need for several containers trying to be neat, this takes the mess out!
, This is the most important appliance in my kitchen. I used it daily, it works great especially helping me chop down almost any ingredient I use in my cooking. The first one I got lasted me over 5 years! And for the price its a bargain. I'm buying...
, My husband bought this for me for my birthday--I use all attachments all the time. The hand blender tears through frozen fruit for smoothies and I no longer have to transfer soups from pan to food processor. The mini chopper will chop lightly, puree...
, Great hand blender. Haven't tried all the attachments yet, but love that bottom is removable and so fully washable without the electrical portion. Blades are sharp and great power in the wand. I use a hand blender for lots of things - from soups and...
, The blender works great. The only complaint that I have is that the sticker that was placed on the blender was too sticky. I have not been able to take it off no matter how many times I have washed it. That is why I have given this product only 4 stars.
, I wanted a stick blender & this is EXACTLY what I was looking for.  It is just perfect!
, Light, Easy to use, space saver, many actions in one item worth every penny.
, To Do Small jobs when I am cooking just for myself. Great for making Homemade Mayonnaise - so much fresher than store bought, and less expensive
, Terrific for pureeing soups and chopping veggies. The uses for this item are numerous and I'm thrilled with my purchase!
, only so so for price
, Great for sauces and soups
, Probably one of the best Cuisinart products out there and well worth the cost.
, Very easy and good to use, but it doesnt come with hanger thats it only drawback.
, I am very pleased with the product and I wish I had it before now. Great kitchen tool.
, This was a wonderful surprise.  It is powerful and yet easy to use.  It does not take up the space of a blender and does a better job than mine.  It doesn't splatter!!!!
, Great for finely chopping veggies.
, We really liked it are using everyday to prepare food for our 7 months old. So far we haven't seen any cons. We are very happy with it and would buy again.
, Couldn't be more pleased with this excellent tool.  Chopper attachment not so huge like others. Easy to clean and store. Very good for dry hard cheese processing.
, Blending sauces, soups, and making frozen drinks.  Also, I use it to make humis.
, Product came with all the attachements you could want for a great price from ABT.
, Very handy kitchen item
, For about 4 years, the wife and I have been using our trusty Braun hand blender. It has never failed us and has been the focal point for our world famous chilled & hot soups. No complaints. Then came the fateful day where the old blender tried to leap ...
, Frothing cream for coffee. Making salsa.
, Great to prepare vegetable soup.  No splashing all over the counter and very easy to clean.
, Presented to my wife for Christmas. She uses it every day for protein shakes, etc.
, Good product however when mixing something really thick it feels like the bottom attachment is going to break. I like all the attachments it comes with. It is mostly used for smoothies and baby food so works great for what we use it for.

, I love this game, great characters, great combat system, great story, Had a Blast!

, Amazing graphics, great weaponry and action... expected violence for the genre.. after all it is crime fighting ;)
, Between the storyline, riddles, and challenges, you could play this for weeks. Game is fun, love flying around the city. Very happy I own this one.
, Game play remains true to the original, providing enhanced graphics. The addition of catwoman for a change of pace offers a nice change in pace.
, Great action and loads of fun, a bit challenging but a great all around game!!!
, my son loves this game!! minimal violence-- good family friendly game
, Great game excellent price! It'll challenge the best!

, This game is simply AWESOME! It feels like you're playing a movie with. The production value in this game is mind-blowing! It can make a Batman fan out of many people for sure!
, I was SO excited to get this game...and I'm not trying to bash it here, it's a great game. But it's not worth all the hype. Skyrim? That's a game that's worth the fanfare...but Batman: Arkham City was a bit of a let-down. The controls are too...

, The game is fantastic. I literally spent 3 or 4 days straight playing it because I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended. And it shipped on time as well.

, Since it is just my husband and me, this 18 cu ft frig will do fine. We have 2 other refrigerators so I am not lacking space. We had a small area to place a frig into and this one fits the bill nicely.
, Great product. I think people should buy this fridge for a garage or man cave. Alot of room and does a great job.
, Great Product. Very Quiet and cool, losts of space. Everything I need in a refrigerator.
, Got this as open box. Very small dent at bottom of handle. Paid great price so no big complaints. Would recommend!

, Great stainless steel fridge. Really like the design and the features inside. Holds gallons in the door which is a space saver. Runs very quiet. The price for this fridge was a fantastic value.
, Overall this refrigerator provides a great value. Not a lot of bells and whistles but makes a great second refrigerator, or is just good if your looking for the least expensive way to go stainless.

, I bought this as my second no frills fridge (my other one is a double door 25 cf), well the no frills makes it have a lot of space, I wonder if I cannot fit more things in this fridge than in my big fridge, so I'm happy with it.
, Used in second home. Good price for the size and looks - have yet to see how well the temp holds and if the plastic drawers and door shelves hold up. Excellent service- prompt delivery, much care taken in bringing items in.
, Since we are just two people, this fridge is all right, and it is very economical to run. But the shelving is insufficient and poorly placed. We had to buy some plastic and wire shelves to make the space work. The bins on the doors are not adjustable...
, good value, timely ship, friendly and helpful deliery
, I bought this unit 2 years and 6 months ago. After 1 year, the unit began making a repeating clunking noise. It didn't affect the performance of the fridge, but it always made me worry that it would go out soon. It manage to last another 1 year and 6 m...
, I just got this today. I love the fact that it completely matches the range I also bought and it was a good price. On the downside it is very loud when I seen it at the store I probably wouldn't have picked it if I knew it ran this loud. Then I read so...
, We bought this fridge for a small kitchen area we have in our finished basement. We needed something that would fit into the dimensions of the space and still be useful. We have this same brand in our full kitchen and were very satisfied so when we wer...
, No frills, great price, nice looking stainless. Runs quiet and efficiently.
, Nice buy at $500 - plenty of room and goes with the stainless steel thing I've got going on. Can't really speak to reliability as it's only been installed a few weeks - but good manufacturer, so hoping it'll be fine!
, A great value for the price. This refrigerator was exactly what I was looking for. Love the closed in backing. No cause for worry about coils or wires having to be properly ventilated. Fit nicely against the wall in between cabinets and looks great in ...
, I purchased this refrigerator in March of 2010, after closing on a house with no appliances. I needed something affordable, but worth keeping at least 3 years. At first the refrigerator fit my needs, I didn't cook much, and it looked okay. Now year and...
, I just got refrigerator 2 hours ago. In the instruction, the sounds is normal. But it has really annoying high pitched noisy humming sound about 10 min after turning on the switch to normal. When I pushed and hold it by the side, the sounds went away f...
, This refrig was a replacement for one I had in the kitchen. The only way to get it in was to remove the doors so space and size governed what I bought. It runs quiet and efficient, and with the full warantee I am very pleased with this purchase! It's s...
, This refrigerator is small, and in a very unclever way. There is some open space in a strange corner, but you really have to bend and reach to put food away. It's uncomfortable. Also, the refrigerator is very noisy and blows cold air out of the sides a...
, I just moved into a new place and had to purchase a a ton of new things including a fridge. Since my money was (not) funny I searched high and low online and in various stores to find a fridge that was inexpensive yet of a decent quality. My search end...
, Almost returned the first unit that was delivered. The freezer top-section cooled fast when it was first turned on but the bottom main unit didn't. I had a couple of Tru-Temps fridge analog temperature scales since I was monitoring our old & failing Cu...
, I love my new fridge, I just wish I had paid closer attention to the fact that it had black sides. For some reason, I thought it would be stainless steel all over. Other than that it is an excellent purchase!
, one word EXELLENT !!!! lOOKS VERY LUKSORY, SO QUIT, SO STRONG, AND BIG , BIG FOR FAMILY OF 3
, Just refinished our basement and this is perfect. Small but larger than some of the undercounter refridgerators that cost twice as much. Didn't go for the ice maker as it's for a basement. Lots of room inside. Small freezer but again, would rather have...
, Really Good Looking On the outside, GREAT STAINLESS STEEL...EVEN BETTER (A LOT) THAN OTHER BRANDS, DO YOUR HOMEWORK, ALMOST NONE FINGERPRINTS, (AND THEY WIPE OUT INSTANTLY!). Interior works fine, it's just a fridge!. I Added the Ice maker (+50), works ...
, It matches my stove perfectly! I added the icemaker to the refrigerator. The size is great. The color matches my stove.
, perfect for our needs, holds a 24 pack of pop! great drawer locations and door storage
, I just purchased this fridge a few months ago ,and am nothing but happy with it. It's quiet ,its extremely efficient ,and right out of the box its factory settings where more than cold enough. The best deal of all ,best buy delivered and set it up ,and...
, Good fridge, great price when I got it. Squeaks like a mouse every once in a while, and feels slightly cool to the touch on the door where it opens, but otherwise great.
, I'm about to have a month with this item and already Had to move the setting from normal cool all the way Up to coldest The freezer part is the same had to turn it all the way And is still not freezing properly :( very disappointed After waiting so lon...
, Frig is nice to look at and works perfectly. Also matches our existing so it looks good.
, Frigidaires are dependable and long-lasting. When you can get an attractive, stainless steel, energy efficient one at a great sale price, you have scored! I needed an average sized fridge for a rental apt and I didn't want a cube or water dispenser on ...

, looks good,works good and a great deal.I bought it along with the stove we like them both,
, Item came as expected except for a small dent. But overall the product was fine. Works well and looks good.
, It looks good. It's cheap. It has wide door shelves that hold a lot. The shelves are well spaced to maximize storage. But the compressor is louder than my previous Maytag fridge, the thing gurgles constantly even when the compressor is off (it sounds...
, Decent product. Fits well in a small city apartment.
, Nice for the small bungalow kitchen!
, it's great, but the proof will be how it performs/lasts over time. Prompt, efficient, friendly delivery and installation
, Ditto the good points a medium size fairly quiet unit with lots of storage.Bonus, Energy Star!Compared to my Maytag this Frigidaire is a good refrigerator flawed by cost cutting. The front rollers are fixed so to level the fridge you need to...
, It holds a lot of stuff for its size, but had one problem where it stopped working. Had to unscrew and rescrew the fuse for that outlet then it started working again. I hope that doesn't happen too often, perhaps it was a fluke.
, Lot of space for it's size. Nice looking.
, glad we got it
, downsized no good review, mislead, etc ... excessive delivery lalpe
, The fridge makes some intermittent noises, not loud, just noticeable. The freezer is a bit small.
, I purchased this unit for a rental. The door shelves are flimsy. I will be surprised if they don't break the first time someone lifts a gallon of milk from the door.
, Seams to be working fine and it's not running all the time.
, I am very satisfied with my purchase. It keeps my foods chillin' like a villain.
, Home use
, First when the fride showed up it was missing a part for the door handle. Now I realize that the seal on freezer doesn't seal correctly.
, It works great. It's clean and looks great. Lots of room.

, Good price and value, but too noisy. Great delivery service.
, This replaced a 21 cu ft 22 year old fridge. It's a little smaller and fits in the alloted space I have. Easy to pull out and clean behind now and then. I do wish it had another shelf in the freezer compartment. Other than that it's a pretty nice...
, This was purchased for office use. It was a great buy for the price.
, Works Great!
, I purchased this refrigerator as a second/beer fridge for the basement. It is just what I wanted at the price I expected. [...]
, this refrigerator is great for my family of 5. the shelving and space is just what i was looking for and the freezer holds so much more than what i was using. i love it.the delivery time was exceptional [...].thank you Abt i will buy from you again.
, I have to say how pleased I am [...]
, Great find, works great, looks great, can get colder than you will ever need.
, I am satisfied with the product but I wish to know where/how can a get extra shelves?
, Not sure? I am having problems currently and I am going to have to call for service. It does not seem to get cold as it should?
, This fridge is what I was hoping. The size and the roomingness. I have read most of the negative reviews, but I think it all depends on what people want. I give this fridge 5 stars.
, We purchased this fridge as an extra for our basement. It's the perfect size, easy to clean, and has plenty of storage space. The shelf in the freezer allows us to pack in twice as much. Very happy with this choice.
, The refrigerator portion is large and able to handle the capacity of food stored inside & on the door.
, i love the fridge i got and for the money i spent on it i believe i got a great deal.
, It was a good price for the area I needed and works just fine.
, I was so pleased to have found a fridge that fit into the rental home I moved into December 2011. Within a matter of months, the handle broke off of the door. I figured this was only cosmetic and not a big issue. Soon the plastic shelves on the door be...
, We bought this fridge as a second fridge for beverages and staples; however, it roomy enough to be a second fridge for everything. Better than advertised. Great price. Delivery was prompt and courteous.
, This unit is in my garage mostly for drinks and overflow from the house. The only thing I would change about this one is stronger racks. Since it is mostly canned drinks in it they are a little weak and bend when loaded.
, I just moved into a new apartment that required that I purchase my own refrigerator. I wanted the cheapest large one I could find and this one fit the bill. It runs great and does the job it's supposed to do. I didn't want anything fancy and this one s...
, I recently replaced an old fridge with this one, my power bill went down $10 from the month that I had my old one to last month. It's a great bang for the buck and if you don't mind wire shelving i would say its good for anyone.
, This is a nice fridge but it is the loudest thing I've ever heard for a brand new appliance. No racks in the freezer.
, I bought it for a second fridge for the basement. It is doing a good job so far. Just the right size for a backup.
, This model has very few bells or whistles but is an excellent refrigerator that is affordable, reliability and dependable.
, Very nice for the price,if it was in the main kitchen it would be a little noisy
, Okay to get buy if your funds are limited. Cheapo materials
, This fridge suits my needs but I would have like a little larger freezer.
, Priced right and American brand. Lots of room without being huge
, Good.Refrigerator for extra fridge. We bought it to put in basement for beverages and extra fridge and freezer space. Only complaint is the wire rack shelves. Flimsy.

, We love the quietness and the big space inside. I was able to load 8 quarts pot by removing one of the utensils basket and small pots on top rack. I had the dishwasher completely full I selected the heavy load wash and the sanitizing I must say I am ve...
, This is a great, quiet dishwasher that was easily installed.
, GREAT PRICE FROM THE STORE LIKED THE FEATURES OF THE SAMSUNG WASHER THE BEST OF ALL.
, Disappointed with performance. Expected a dramatic difference between our old unit and this one and there wasn't.
, Installation was wonderful.  The machine works well if you run it right after meal but don't let it sit overnight and expect the dishes to come clean!!
, The quick wash cycle is a life saver. No difference in performance from standard cycle.
, This dishwasher makes doing the dishes a pleasure. It does take a few loads to figure out the best way to load everything, but your dishes will come out nicely cleaned.  Even pots get throughly cleaned( haven't needed to use the Storm Wash yet).  The t...
, I LOVe IT!!! This is one amazing dishwasher!!!
, Very flexible in loading.  I like the Auto Cycle which is what I generally use. Glasses are clearer than the old washer although I switched rinse agent. Holds a lot.
, Can,t Believe how quiet our samsung dishwasher is. Living in a open home design has us really appreciating it's engineering and design.
, Doesn't complete cycles without flashing alert lights
, We have had this dishwasher for a little over 2 months and so far have been very happy with its performance. I have read other reviews that claim dishes do not come out completely clean or dry. We have not experienced any such problems, regardless of t...
, This dishwasher has a beautiful clean design. I chose the black model because of the ease of maintenance and it matched my other applicances. I am very happy with the options of adjustable top shelf for larger items on the bottom and the stainless stee...
, It is just my handicapped wife and myself but a lot of bowls, pots , and dishes to clean. I looked up reviews on the internet for the best dishwashers and this model was given high marks over other models including some Bosch. I purchased this model be...
, We found it a little difficult at first to load the dishes and didn't think it would hold as many dishes as our old dishwasher...however, after retraining ourselves :), we actually find this model holds many more dishes than our previous dishwasher and...
, I really love the space this item has... I have been able to put more dishes including pots and pans in one wash cycle. I feel that this product is a great buy for the home but I wish that they way the machine dries would be a lot better..
, works great - looks great - and is very quiet. Does have a strange odor after the first few runs, but that goes away. The store rep said that was just some of the material adjusting to the heat from the dryer heating element. May leave a little water o...
, First Samsung product that I have ever bought, won't be the last. Super quiet operation. Very complete instal instructions and easy to follow. Easy to operate, very sylish with clean lines. Stainless Steel is easy to clean. No residue on any dish's eve...
, Very happy with this dishwasher. It is extremely quite and gets the dishes squeaky clean. It is a HUGE upgrade from what I had before.
, Looks great next to the Samsung refrigerator. Holds more than our old Kenmore. Unit sits very close to the floor so I had to get rid of the old copper water line and replaced it with a flexible hose which fits better in the unit's space provided. No pr...
, Have had about a month and a half. Works very good. Very quiet. Takes dried and baked on stuff off. Have not had to rewash one thing yet. Like the ability to take parts of dish holders to get over sized objects in for a wash.
, I like Samsung electronic products but this dishwasher has been a bust. I purchased this product because I thought it was the best looking dishwasher on the market and because of Samsungs reputation for quality. Too many error codes. The latest is erro...
, Returning it after 3 uses. I have one good thing to say about it - it's really quiet. Otherwise, it doesn't clean as well as the 17 year old Whirlpool I replaced with it! Our old one was on its last leg & I was essentially washing dishes before I loade...
, This dishwasher is so quiet I barely hear it when I am in the same room! The performance is fabulous. I cook a lot and have a ton of pans and plates to wash on a regular basis. The storm wash feature does a great job at even getting stuck on lasagna of...
, We returned this machine after less than 30 days. The soap dispenser only opened on occasion, therefore forcing us to rewash loads multiple times. When the soap dispenser did indeed open, the dishes were not always clean. The only way they consistently...
, I received this dishwasher as a gift for my new house. I read reviews on items before I buy them so I have less problems when I take them home. I definitely would NOT have purchased this particular dishwasher seeing all the bad reviews and lo-and-behol...
, Great dishwasher for the price. Would recommend to anyone.
, Great dishwasher! Very happy with my purchase. Dishes are very clean and you don't hear it running. Looks great in kitchen
, I bought this dishwasher because it was one of the quietest models available. When it runs, it does get dishes clean, if it's loaded properly. First problem I had was that it would not turn on without having the circuit breaker turned off and back on a...
, I had this dishwasher installed in February 2011 and have already had 2 service calls on it. The first one shortly after installation: every other load would stop partially with an error 0E. Technician replaced water level sensor after conferring wit...
, We have had the Samsung DMT800RHS/XAA dishwasher for about ten months now and I must say that, overall, I regret buying it. I wish that we had bought the Kitchenaid that we were considering, instead. Although the DMT800 is very quiet during 90% of its ...
, I have read the other reviews, my experience was much better. This item is so quiet you dont even know when it is on. The features are amazing and easy to use. I love the half load feature wich activates the bottom rack only which saves time and energy...
, We bought this dishwasher after having researched for the top quaility of dishwashers online, and this Samsung rated #1 or tops in many survey's. We've used it maybe 3 times and the control panel has COMPLETELY short-circuited making the dishwasher utt...
, When I was contemplating the purchase of this dishwasher, i was hesitant for a couple of reasons; first the price, second the mixed reviews online, and third, the lack of product recognition, in that when i think of Samsung, I think TVs and other elect...
, MY HUSBAND LOVES IT. HE NEVER SAYS ANYTHING POSITIVE WITH ANYTHING I BUY. HE SAYS IT DOES A GREAT JOB AND IS SOOO QUIET. I LOVE IT TOO.
, After reading reviews on this page, I was hesitant to buy the model, but I did because I thought price to features it was a good deal and we also have had a Samsung refrigerator for two years and this would be a nice aesthetic match. I read the same ki...
, After owning it for two months, it wouldn't drain. Had to call Samsung to come and repair it..The repairman didn't know how to pull it out to take it apart, so I had to take a 2nd day off work for his supervisor to come and give a lesson on how to lift...
, The dishwasher looks beautiful, cleans well and is very, very quiet. Just a few issues, which are minor. Top rack rows are odd, can only accommodate larger diameter glasses in some rows, other rows would probably only fit really small glasses like a sh...
, The dishwasher we had before this was so noisy you couldn't watch television in the next room. You don't know that this Samsung is running. It stanless steal but has that little area at the top for controls. We love it!

, I love the swivel head which makes it easy to manuver around furniture and the detachable hand held is easy to detach and get the baseboards and counter tops. Works great on upholstery too. Definitely great value for the suction and ease of operation.
, Very happy with this purchase! Use it often. Being cordless & light weight make it quick & easy to use in any area.
, Loving this smaller vac! Amazing technology to have a wireless vacuum, so absolutely an upgrade from the old school versions. Has a cool stand charger -- I thought I would hide it in a closet, but it's actually kinda cool so I keep it out in the open (...
, Great vacuum, and it's cordless! But charging it is kind of annoying.
, Overall this would be a good choice, but we have a cat and deep pile carpeting and within five minutes the rotation and suction would get stuck....had to return it for a different model.
, Like I said, bought it for a friend and she's thrilled with it. No problems so far!
, The Electrolux stick/hand vac is a great value. If you are looking to have a device that can transition from hardwood to carpet without changing a setting, this is what you are looking for. The dust/debris container is not at large as a full blown vacu...
, I bought this vaccuum cleaner because I have neck and back problems and wanted something easy to handle.
, Very good value and my wife loves it. Handy small unit comes off for hard to reach areas. Best small vaccum we have had in 20 years.
, A cost effective, useful tool and that i just love. If you need something to just pick up items crumbs, dust bunnies, and/or little stuff that can show up on your tile and hard wood floors it does a nice job and it super simple to use.
, Was looking for a reasonably priced, reliable vacuum and I found it in this Electolux. I've had it for a couple of weeks and so far very happy with it. Got it on sale and that made it even better!
, This vacuum is the best I have ever seen in my life. It does not bother me to clean my rugs or carpet anymore. It is light yet very powerful. You do not need to unplug it to anything. I can even use it to clean my wood floors. The price is very afforda...
, This is overall a great buy. The charging station is nice and easy. The battery has a fast charge and a pretty good life span when using it. I bought it for the extensive hardwoods I have and it performs great on the wood, tile and rugs that are not cu...
, After much research, I decided I wanted the Ergorapido. My brother got it for me as a gift and I love it! Some of the reviews complained about the battery life but I'm not using it as a whole house vacuum so I've never had a problem with it, after all ...
, This vac comes in handy for small tasks like dog hair because when being used for more than 30 mins battery dies down. Can be used for vacation house.
, I like what I have seen so far as to the ease in using this vacuum. I wanted it for quick kitchen floor clean ups, which is working well.
, This is a great little vacuum for quick pickups. I use the hand vac on my stairs and the suction is great. I use it to clean up the kitty litter that comes off my kitty's paws and it actually sucks it up instead of it being spit out like most vacuums w...
, Just great ready to use. Has great pick up. Good for cleaning blind little places. Just all around great little vac and so easy to use and store.
, Works great on tile and my daughter does not mind using it. She thought it was fun for a few weeks, but then she learned it was a chore, but still uses it when we ask.
, I love my vacuum! I debated if I'd really use it all the time and I constantly find myself vacuuming. Its just so easy to pick up off the charging stand and put backon too.
, I would recomend this to anyone who likes to keep floors clean on a daily basis.
, Better than we hoped. Does a great job for quick cleaning. Can use all over the house. Easy to charge, easy to store and looks good too.
, Nice product. Cleans good. I use it on stairs and furniture and very pleased with the product. Haven't had it long enough to know quality of battery life. Easy enough that my kids can use.
, This vacuum is surprisingly strong for its size, considering that it is the lower-powered option of this model. Emptying and cleaning the device is very simple, and the options for the charger make it easy to store. Being able to use it as a stick or h...
, This is my second Electrolux after owning much more expensive brands for decades. I have 5 cats and must have a powerful vacuum that is lightweight--I have shoulder issues--easily stored and cordless. I also require bagless vacuums as the ones with bag...
, Great sweeper for hardwood and tile. Feels way better built than our old powered swiffer (we've gone through several over the years). The suction is better too
, I love this product. It is easy to use. Always charged and ready to go and has very good suction.
, I live in my RV and this vac is exactly what i needed. I like the swivel head and the fact that it has a small footprint. Cordless is the way to go in an RV. It works ok on low pile area rugs and great on the wood and tile surfaces. I would recommend t...
, If it's possible to be in love with an inanimate object, then I am! This stick vacuum is light and powerful.
, I love this vacuum cleaner. My husband and I live in a small apartment, so we knew we needed to get a stick vac. Not only does this vacuum look great - but it picks dirt up so easily on hardwood and carpet, and is very easy to clean. I really like the...
, Pros: -Lightweight -Decent price -Strong suction -Cordless -Easy to use Cons: -Shouldn't be used a primary vacuum cleaner
, This thing is great...keeps a charge and picks up everything. I've tried a lot of cordless before, but this one is the best!
, This is a great little vacuum. I use it for quick pick ups... such as area rugs to cleaning the seeds under the bird cage. It has great suction power. Love the hand held option and the attachments. Also, very stylish.
, Plenty of power to clean my 1 bedroom apartment floor & carpet. 1 use will fill up the container tho.
, This vacuum is so nice and light weight. It is a joy to pull off of the charger and run through the rooms with tile and wood floors. It works so nicely on steps also. It is very easy to dump and clean out the canister.
, Was tired of my brooms and sweeper constantly falling down in my kitchen, so I ordered this stick/vac for convenience. When I set it up, I noticed that it does not lock into place to stand up, the picture is deceiving. In my kitchen I need to move...
, I have a small condo and this is perfect for cleaning my new laminate flooring and tile. It's quick, fairly quiet (compared to my Hoover) and does a great job. I can use it the bedrooms that have carpet and it works well too. The collection area gets...
, This is the perfect quick pickup vacuum. Having no cord to drag around is great. It makes everything that much quicker. I use it on tile and carpet and it does great on both. Just know that the attachments are inside the recharging base. I thought I...
, If I could love a vacuum cleaner, this Electrolux would be the one. Lightweight, cordless and maneuverable in smaller spaces. Great on carpets and my hardwood floors. Easy to remove dirt from canister. If this is your only vaccuum, it may be a pain if...

, I bought this cordless vac to use for quick clean ups. It works very well for this. It rolls easily and swivels exceptionaly well. The suction is adequate and it is simple to empty. I have yet to run the battery completely down. I am very pleased with...
, I dont have much carpet but it cleans up very well i love it
, I love this vacuum. The best I have ever used. I have 3 sheding dogs and I use this vacuum at least 3x daily without the struggle of cords and weight. I strongly recommend this cordless vaccum. Great suction!
, I had almost given up on cordless vacuums until I read the reviews on the Electrolux and decided to give it one more try. I can't be more pleased. It does everything it promises to do and everything I needed it for.
, Lightweight, portable and extremely easy to use. My kids love it, which means they use it very often. I have wood flooring and have not had any problems with scratching...great product for the money.
, This is the best cleaning tool I've gotten in a long time. Someone purchased it off my registry and we haven't stop using it since the wedding shower. It's awesome as a floor vac, great as a handheld, I just love it!
, Very maneuverable and light, looks cool charging so you don't have to hide it. Works great on hard floors, not great on carpet. Dust cup easy to empty, hand vac has 2 attachments, crevice and a little brush. Basically a great replacement for a broom...
, My large vacuum cleaner is so bulky and heavy. I wanted something that I could use daily and wouldn't strain my back. This is just what I needed. It's pretty powerful for such a small appliance and I love the fact that I can pull out the handheld...
, I love that this vac has a detachable hand vac on it. it comes in very handy. The dust trap can be a bit time consuming to empty, but I haven't had any problems with the dust leaking out of the dust trap like I have with other bag less vacs before....
, Light weight powerful
, I am very happy with this product which I planned to buy long time

, This is a great vacum woith adequate suction. If you have deep pile carpet, this is not your choice. It is really meant for hardwoods or Oriental carpets with no pile. I esp. like the attachments which are stored in the unit and the handheld is a great...
, Cannot say enough about how much I love this stick vacuum. Lightweight, no cords, not noisy and doesn't terrify the cat. My house is primarily hardwood floors and oriental carpets so it is perfect for me. Holds its charge long enough for me to do a...
, This is a great vacuum. Works well if you want to do a quick clean up. Cleans up everything from dog hair, to wood pieces. The only thing it doesn't work well on is thick carpets.
, I have two shedding dogs, two toddlers and 2500 Sq foot house with dark wood floors. When you set your expectations on the reality of what a small cordless rechargeable vacuum was designed to do, it does the job expertly. I use this daily as a light...
, I am pleased with this stick vac. It is a stick and you have to keep that in mind. It doesn't work great on carpet but is good on wood, etc floors. The charge time doesn't last long so you have to move quickly and give it time to charge before using...
, First off, this is a stick vaccum. It is not to replace your regular vaccum. Some reviews talk about how it doesn't work on carpet well. It shouldn't. It's not made for carpet, it says that on the box. This is great for quick clean ups. Some reviews...
, We needed a light portable vacuum to use on hardwood floors in our little shop in an old house. This vacuum looked like it would do the trick but after over a week of daily use it has come up short.
, I am so pleased with my purchase. As the owner of 2 shedding dogs, hardwood floors, and tile floors, I need to sweep constantly. I shopped specifically for a cordless vacuum that would be quick, easy, and efficient. This is exactly that. It has strong...

, We use this vac all the time, we had another one different name brand that died and we bought this one it is very light can be carried up the stairs and used upstairs and down, my wife and I love that thing. You will not be sorry if you buy this item. ...
, Surprisingly effective sweeper. Super easy and convenient, always ready. We have it in the office and we pull it out to do a floor when we need it. No issues with battery or power.
, Not so great for well known product. glorified over ppriced and useless for a maticulous peson As myself a paaper towel and spray bottle does a nicer job. foe a electrolix being such a strong. Brand i go one star for name only performance zero a d suck...
, Used my Kirby on the rug, went back over it with this stick vac, and it picked up even more pet hair. Easy to store in a small place in our motorhome. I looked for a long time for the perfect vac for our motorhome, and this is working out perfectly.
, I have one word to say. This is one of the best products I bought in a long time. LG, Bosch pale comparative of the quality and price with Electrolux. That was just a word ;-)
, We bought this stick vac a year ago for quick cleanups on our hardwood and tile. After a year of use it's now pretty much worthless. The battery no longer holds a charge, and on the rare occasion we can get it to charge it has lost pretty much all suct...
, Great for wood or tile floors. Not so good on carpets.
, After surviving with a small hand vacuum for so long, it was a big change to switch to a larger one. This one really does the trick. In the past I had to use a comb on the carpet to get the cat hair out because the small vacuum wouldn't cut it. This on...
, This vacuum is great. It's light weight, easy to maneuver and has great suction. It does a fantastic job of picking up dog fur and dust from my wood floors and area rugs. I am amazed at how much dirt, dust and fur this vacuum sucks up. The only bad thi...

, This fridge has cold spots in the drawer and up on top shelf. It freezes the food that is in that area at times. The freezer stopped making ice because of a computer malfunction. I like that it has a water and ice dispenser on the front.

, this refrigerator has all the features that I was looking for at a great price. A very good value. The only thing that it could improve is the noise level of the ice maker.

, We researched several Brands And Compared Ratings.Top Rated & Not Disappointed. Stainless Steel Looks Great Top.
, Had the fridge for about 4 months. Very satisfied. Ice bin is small than we are used to. With summer coming up, we will see if it is a problem.
, We are very pleased with this fridge. We had read reviews prior to purchase and some had said the fridge was noisy. I disagree with those reviews, our fridge is quite. The only sound you hear is the ice dropping into bin and it's not that noticeable.
, I was looking for a very spacious two door fridge and found a great one for the price.
, The refrigerator has met my expectations for me and my family. It has plenty of room for our titems and we are allow in moving the shelves to our convinient. Also the freezer shelves preserve the items there.

, The noise levels on this refrigerator are very noisy. The fan runs all the time. I had a cheaper Kenmore that you couldn't hear at all. I wish I would have kept my old appliance.
, Will not own any appliance other than Whirlpool! Whirlpool is the best appliances we have ever owned!
, Large interior capacity. Good exterior appearance. In door icemaker - space saver, little noisier than previous model.
, I really like how roomy it is. It is black, but does not show finger prints. It really lights up when you open the door so you can see what is inside. VERY quiet.
, My only complaint so far is the amount of stickers and tape that came on all the interior shelving. I'm sure they served a purpose when putting the fridge together but they are time consuming to remove. Other then that, I'm extremely pleased with this ...
, We are very pleased that we decided to purchase a Whirlpool refrigerator/freezer. It is easy to find space for everything in the refrigerator and we definitely like having the ice maker in the door, adding more space where it is needed.
, Lighting in the freezer is excellent for finding those hidden frozen treasures. Also enough space in fridge and good shelf spacing.
, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER HAD A REFRIG THAT WOULD KEEP MILK AS LONG AS THIS ONE I CAN KEEP MILK FOR TWO WEEKS AND ICE CREAM I HAVE NEVER A REFRIG TO KEEP ICE CREAM
, Good refrigerator. Not as attractive as the GE profile it replaces but probably more reliable.
, This refrigerator replaced a 28-year-old but still functional fridge. It is not really an improvement, except for the water and ice dispenser in the door. The door makes a loud annoying click when opened and closed. The space isn't well configured. Bec...

, This being my first experience with Stainless Steel I really do not like it. It shows everything fingerprints and smudges. It is very hard to keep clean. I have all Stainless Steel Kitchen Appliances and they are all Whirlpool. It keeps me very busy cl...
, Everything about it is perfect. Design, functionality, size, amount of space. The only problem I have is that the door does not close with a normal gentle shove. Get's close to locking and then stops.
, I am very happy with this product! My only issue is that there could have been some more shelves in the freezer, and the water from the door is not super cold.
, Good frig. Only downfall, the icemaker has minimal capacity, thus you will run out of ice if you have company over. Secondly, the ice maker is noisy and will make intermittant sounds throughout the day. I don't know why, as the sound is not the ice dro...
, This fridge works excellent! I've had the fridge now for about 3 months, and haven't had a single problem. The controls are easy to understand and easy to use. When they designed the ice/water into the freezer door, it created a ton of extra space to s...
, Love the nickel plates color and the size just perfect for your jugs of juice or milk
, We are very pleased with this unit. If your company can come up with a way to stop the smudging and fingerprints on the stainless steel units that would be awesome. I have 2- 9 year olds and clean hands are not there concern.
, Love this refrigerator especially the ice on the door. Would like one more shelf in both the refrigerator and freezer but overall very pleased with the product.

, I chose this refrigerator because of the in door ice maker and am very happy with it. Many other features are offered in competing products.
, It has alota room and like the adjustable shelves.
, I love this fridge, however there are not a lot of options when it comes moving shelves. If you put them in the wrong places the doors won't close, so you are limited on your options.
, Easy to use.Our 2 favorite features are the ice maker in the door and the door open reminder. PERFECT for our growing family!
, For myself, it was too big. And there were shelves in the way of places you'd want to put things. I wasn't impressed. Returned.
, A 10 out 10.love door ice maker it opens much more room
, The installation was a snap since we replaced an older unit that had a ice maker in it. The design and appearance is sharp and I have recieved compliments from, of all people, contractors that are renovating my basement. We have already noticed a reduc...

, It's a little early to write a comprehensive review because we're getting the ice maker set up only this week (2 months after purchase). But we're happy with everything so far.
, We are very pleased with our new refrigerator! We like the icemaker on the door rather than taking up space in the freezer. There seems to be so much more room in the fridge part also. Plenty of space for all our needs as a family of four. We would buy...
, Easy to clean. Ice cube maker doesn't take up too much room in freezer section. I like that I can use magnets on the doors.
, This product is very well made and performs exactly as advertised. It is a great buy for the money and meets all our expectations.
, We looked at many brands prior to purchsing the Whirlpool. We love it.
, This frig has more room than appears even in the freezer. Lighting is bright in frig. Only thing missing was bin for your eggs. I like the idea of ice within the door allowing for more freezer room.
, I love my whirlpool refrigerator. It has so much room. The ice maker in the door is the best keep secret. i have so much more room in my freezer. I can see where everything is at a glance, when I open the door to the freezer. The lighting inside the re...
, We absolutely love our new fridge!!! It's fits perfect in our new kitchen and love all the wonderful features it has for my family to have easy use!!!
, Product is easy friendly usable, roomy, and love it doesn't have prints on it when doors are touched. Temperature is consistent. Only thing I wish to change would be having another shelf . This would help to organize items inside for smaller items
, Slow ice maker. Ice cubes are too small..............
, I like this refrigerator overall. It has more interior space than my last refrigerator of the exact same size. The downside is the water dispenser is agonizing slow and the ice dispenser is almost impossible to use without ice flying all over. In hinds...
, IWe purchased our new Whirlpool side by side about 3 months ago. We replaced a higher priced Samsung side by side after it malfunctioned in just over 2 years. The Whirlpool has most of same features plus plenty of lights so that you can see in every co...
, Layout good in fridge and freezer but ice maker slow to make even on high speed and small cubes. Good fridge layout especially on doors. Less shelf customization though. Handles stick out some but otherwise sleek profile. Excellent drawer space too.
, i'm very happy with my refrigerator. the design, accessibility and features are just what I was looking for, and the price was fair for what we were getting. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this refrigerator.
, This is my 4th and last Whirlpool refrigerator. Worst refrigerator I've ever seen. Only has one wheel in front which lead to the frame warping under the weight of the empty refrigerator, this makes it impossible to pull out to clean behind or service w...
, This refrigerator is extra spacious with the ice maker built into the freezer door and the extra large compartments on the refrigerator door. Plus, the black finish always looks like I just polished it.
, We purchased this product for our business, and it's met all of our needs. It's held up to the frequent use from all of our employees, been easy to keep clean, and with the finish on the outside of the refridgerator it hasn't left hand prints or any ma...
, Features are good and design is modern. Ice maker is loud.
, Besides paying more money for an upgraded refrigerator that the builder installed into a space that prevents the storage drawers on the refrigerator side to be removed for cleaning, I am bothered by the difficulty to keep the stainless steal finish cle...
, Why don't you make a double door without the ice machine! If I am trying to save money and don't use much ice, this takes up unnecessary room in my freezer and is ugly on the outside. Offer more options.
, The top shelf is placed too high for 5'2 people. I cannot reach the items placed near the rear, much less put them there. The freezer portion needs another shelf. The ice drop makes too much noise. I would like a special place for the butter that is c...
, Bought this fridgebecause we needed something within our price range that was large enough for our growing family. We are quite happy with it!
, The fridge is well designed and well built. A quality item.
, Very easy to use. and cool design.but easy to g et finget print.
, Having the in door ice system leaves a lot of shelf space in the freezer..
, The unit run a lot, noisy, difficult to clean. I am not able to pull it out for cleaning because it is not on rollers like my old unit. The freezer does not have enough shelves. The stainless front came with indentations on the freezer door, replaced a...
, Great refrigerator. Things are really easy to get on and off helves and a lot of storage for taller items. Wish i had saved some of the shelves from the old unit for the freezer, but i made some. quiet compared to other units and easy to clean.
, This is a great fridge. You have a lot of options where you want your shelving. My family uses a mass amount of ice everyday, and on some days it doesn't keep up. The ice maker is in the door, so the freezer is better on space. I had an older side by s...
, I would purchase another Whirlpool refrigerator in the future, however, I would most likely choose one upgraded a notch. I had to purchase two additional shelves; One for the refrigerator and one for the freezer which amounted to an extra couple hundre...
, After spending months researching hundreds of refrigerator models we decided on Whirlpool. Appearance, quality and design are perfect for us.
, Perfect size for all of my needs. In-door Ice maker & water is flawless and never drips. Easily adjustable shelves and easy to clean drawers
, Best refrigerator I have had so far. Quiet, efficient and convenient, .
, I love the exterior finish. It does not show finger marks! And matches other brands of stainless finish in other appliances in my kitchen. The only negative I have is it seems to take longer than average for the ice bin to refill but I will admit that ...
, First side by side we've owned. Still getting used to the difference in organizing space.
, I like pretty much everything about this product, but could use more shelves in the refridgerator side.
, The refrigerator has alot of space and is easily configurable to match my needs. Amount and size of door storage is wonderful! Ice is plentiful and fast.
, shelving is plentiful, and indoor icemaker is a huge space saver. would definitely recommend this refrigerator to anyone in the market.
, Size just right for me .i love the style and make.easy to clean.
, This unit serves it's purpose, but there are a couple things that could be improved upon. 1. It's a bit noisy when the water runs (for the ice). 2. The shelves in the door are too shallow and are very limited as to where they can be placed. 3. There sh...
, I do not like that it does not despense cold water out of the door. The water is only tepid. The one we had for 18 years the water was cold. This unit does not seem to get as cold in the refrigeratpr compartment as the old one. I have it turned down to...
, My husband likes that this product has a alarm if the doors are not closed all the way. Setting the temp of the freezer or food section is easy with the controls on the out side. Just the fact that there is a water filter and air filter is amazing to m...
, We had an stainless steel model before. Not sure we like the new metal and the ice maker is super loud. Had enough of it but we're past the 30 day return period. Liked the old one better.
, Bought this Whirlpool because it was the best reviewed and the largest available in our price range. It has huge amounts of room, keeps lots of ice ready to go. Lots of shelf space, top shelf is a little strange, it is too short for milk but is also so...
, Easy opening doors and access to all shelves. Ice maker and water dispenser functions are easy to use. The ice maker in the door feature is one of the main reasons we chose this model. The water filter access appears to be very convenient as well. Grea...
, works like a fridge should, that's all she wrote!!
, very roomy, just the perfect size we were looking for.
, This is our second one due too the 1st one being a lemon! Hade several issues with the 1st one. Ice maker, moisture problems! The replacement has been way better so far!
, Like everyone, we did hours of research to narrow our choices before seeing them on the display floor. Deciphering so much info was mind numbing but the theme remained constant. Whirlpool gave us the best hope for reliability and service, if needed. Ou...
, Our old 36 refrigerator was shorter than those made today . . . this was the shortest one we could find to fit the space we had. It also has low profile hinges which helped. We like the ice maker in the door but it tends to jam if unused for several d...
, The refrigrator has many good features. Do not like the idea of changing water filter often and ice maker is a little noisy but having it on the door gives more space.
, We purchased a Whirlpool refrigerator again, due to the fact we still have our original one which is now 31 years old, and still as cold as ever, even though the one that went out was only 13 years old. We are disappointed that only 3 months after purc...
, No issues, although section in between the doors when open gets quite warm.
, The only con I have found is there is not a covered butter keeper on the door. Otherwise, it is a great product.
, We put in a Whirlpool dishwasher, microwave & refrigerator- now looking for a Stainless oven.
, This refrigerator was one of my first purchases when I bought my house last spring. The design, technology, space, size, etc. are all very good. I'm happy with this choice! The only complaints I have is that the water dispenser is a little slow. If the...
, I Was Pleased To Know That My Builder Used Whirlpool Appliance When Purchasing My New Home.
, If the icemaker had a sound dampener it would be great!
, This refrigerator was selected over Samsung's in-door ice maker refrigerator because the reviews stated it had a better design. All that has been true, and even with a family of four we seem to have trouble filling it up - it's the best inside design o...
, We love being able to wipe the doors off with a wet rag instead of using stainless steel cleaner wonderful plus. I hope I can find this technology in a dishwasher and stove when I'm in the market. We love the size inside the freezer with the ice maker ...
, The product is affordable, reliable and well designed.
, Same outside size as unit it replaced, but much more functional with better features. Ice maker design adds lots more usable space to freezer section.
, Awesome fridge! Only issue is ice maker is a little loud when you use it, but nothing that would stop me from purchasing it!
, I would buy a second fridge for extra storage if I needed a second right now but I have one already!
, My wife and I replaced a smaller Whirlpool side by side unit that stopped working after 11 years. As long as we are updating our kitchen, we decided to also update the appliances. We have been satisfied with the Whirlpool brand in the past, but you can...
, It's all I thought it to be just the right sizes, color and I'm enjoying every bit of it
, The best thing about this fridge is it that is plug it in and forget. No fussing with ice compartments or moving shelves so things won't freeze. And fast ice is a great feature when having partys.
, Love this product and all the features like the graphys on the outside of the door over the water dispenser !!! The performance is GREAT !! But, after a few months of use, it has be come very noisey when the interior fan or compressor is running.
, This refrigerator replaced a Kitchen Aid Superba side-by-side. I only have two minor concerns. First, the compressor is quite loud when it kicks on, which is very different from my old refrigerator. Second, I had to replace the filter only after three ...
, We have not any issues since getting about 6 months ago. We have enjoyed it.
, no brainer picking this product. do it agian easily
, I especially love the ice maker and dispenser being in the door rather than in the freezer space. we have a large family and the fast ice feature is used quite frequently, thank you
, This unit has a sleek modern look to it...inside and out. Easy to clean and store items--plenty of options for storage. Various sized drawers and compartments make supplying the fridge easy.
, This fridge is alittle on the small side. It matches my other whirlpool appliances. The stainless exterior is hard to keep clean. The Ice despener sometimes has water at the beginning of despensing. The water despenser shoots water out and does make a ...
, I purchase this fridge about six months ago. So far I've been happy with its performance, the internal layout of shelves and drawers, and the lighting is very good compared to some of the other fridges we looked at. My only complaint is the ice maker: ...
, Pros: Looks nice, modern, classy. Works well so far, I've had it 6 months, just changed the water filter the first time, which was very easy compared to my last fridge. I like the appearance so much I would definately buy it again even though there are...
, Awesome fridge. purchased this fridge after many checking some reviews and has worked great. Only complaint is the sound level on the ice machine when turning ob for water. But stainless has no flaws no prints after touching and very easy to clean insi...
, Unexpectedly (of course) we had to buy a new refrigerator...our old model we had for about 15 years, so with all of the new technology out there we were quite overwhelmed with choices. We love this model - the freezer has excellent space - the ice bin ...
, The outer skins of this refrigerator of stainless steel with no plastic trim to be seen, is a much better improvement than the last fridge we had. It's easy to keep clean, and has the appearance of a professional appliance. It's a little cramped for sh...
, We purchased this fridge this summer and have been happy overall. However, there are a few shortcomings. The biggest of which is the lack of shelves in the freezer and lack of a dairy compartment (top of fridge door). One has to stack things several it...
, Brand new fridge started leaking water from the water filter area due to defective water supply lines. Took about 3 weeks for the repair to take place because the replacement parts were not available from the manufacturer.
, The features are nice, but the water dispenser is slow even with the valve wide open and the first cup of water is always warm. It is also noisier than the old refrigerator.
, This refrigerator has been excellent. It is a little loud when water goes to the ice maker, but that is the only time. It has worked well and I love it. I would definitely buy this again.
, Very noisy. Ice maker will wake you up at night. Ice maker spits ice all over your floor. Top shelf too shallow for milk, juice, soda bottles. Cheaply made, poor design.
, It's a nice looking refrigerator and works fine. The plastic door organizers are poorly designed. I can't put a gallon milk jug in the door shelf, and I miss my butter door from my old refrigerator. We are thrilled to have ice and water through the doo...
, This Refrigerator has simplicity of use, is sleek in its appearance, and keeps my food at the correct temperature. The best part of all is that I was looking for an American made refrigerator that was very reliable. I am thrilled that this is made in A...
, I have this fridge and I love all the space and the water filter.
, What you see is what you get. This item suites my needs. I would recommend this item.
, I didn't really get to choose my appliances but this refridgerator is great. There are some minor things I don't like. The ice maker is in the door I love but, if you use too much ice out of the full bucket it can take up to 24 hours for it to make mor...
, Energy saving item. Love the look of it. Great to have in my home
, We love the look of the unit and ease in cleaning. I would like to have more flexibility in shelf height. The major downside is that the ice container is too small and we had to remove the filter to make the unit produce more ice.
, I love the look and operation of my Whirlpool refrigerator. Only negative would be problems with the ice maker.
, I love my whirlpool fridge. It has everything. I bought several other products as well.
, The frig does not have wheels that make it difficult to move and the Ice & water dispensers are difficult to activate.
, Right after the refrigerator was installed, there were problems with the ice maker. After three service calls, the tech realized that the wrong switch had been installed (at the factory) in the door for the ice maker. Shortly after, we noticed water on...
, When our 10 year old refrigerator made by another company quit working we called an independent repairman who is a friend of the family. He patched up the problem but was unsure whether it would hold. He said the repairs wouldn't have been needed had w...
, Overall we've enjoyed our new fridge. It's kind of loud when the ice maker is being used or reservoir being filled and the water that is dispensed is not very cold, but other than that we have liked it for the month or so we've had it. It seems sturdy ...
, I bought this refrigerator about 6 months ago. I haven't had any problems so far. It has nice features. The ice maker is very quiet and the crushed ice is a nice addition. The water filter works great and makes the water taste like bottled water.
, Simply love it.... The look, the operation, everything!
, I am very pleased with our choice again. This is my third Whirlpool appliance and second refrigerator by Whirlpool.
, I am very pleased with my purchase. My electric bill has decreased significantly since I put the Whirlpool refrigerator in my home. The water filtration system produces good tasting water in a city with notoriously bad water and the filter is easy to r...
, Very happy with my purchase. I find new things every day since I bought my new refrigerator. Keeps everything nice and cold and so spacious too. I am a chef and need the room. This has it all!!
, We love the ice in the door feature. It frees up the freezer space to use for food. The interior of both freezer and refrigerator have very good lighting. We are very please with this product and would recommend it.
, I love it .. it is big and roomy never run out of ice and very quiet
, Love the shelving in both the refrigerator and freezer. Having the ice maker on the door allows more room in the freezer. The only thing I don't like is ice maker shut off is behind the ice maker.
, I really like the unit except that whirlpool decided to change the water filter size from a previous model that I owned. Now I have filters that are worthless. The location of the shelving is poor design shelving has very little adjustability.
, The ice maker has a small bin and makes very loud noises when a new set of cubes are dumped. We would not have purchased this refrig if we know how noisy it was. we can hear the ice dropping all over the house.
, I am very happy with selecting the side by side fridge freezer I chose! It is much larger than the one I had previously.
, no complaints about this refrigerator, except the ice maker is VERY LOUD!!
, This product has the icemaker on the freezer door allowing you to be able to store more food in the freezer section. The refrigerator has ample room for milk, etc. with large fruit and vegetable drawers.
, Rating would be excellent, except that we had to order extra shelves
, I love my fridge it is so great looking and performs wonderful and keeps food cold and frozen would definetly recommend it
, We are able fit all the food our large family needs in this refrigerator. There is plenty of room and easy access to everything we need.
, Pros: Ice maker in the door instead of a shelf makes shelf space more usable. Ice chute delivers most of the ice to your cup instead of the floor like some other models I've seen. Matches stainless appliances for a slightly lower price. Cons: Refrigera...
, We switched from an over/under to a side-by-side, so it's taking some getting used-to. Overall though, it's been a fine refrigerator. You do lose some space with the ice/water in the door, but it's a compromise we can live with. There's plenty of room....
, No negatives with the exception of the ice maker is excessively noisy.
, Love the in door water and ice feature. Tall enough for larger glasses. Set up was very easy and there is lots of room on the fridge side. I really like having the ice bucket on the inside of the door too. Don't see finger prints on the door either - l...
, The refrigerator is great. Spacious, bright and the shelves are easy to move around as needed for space. The freezer is a nightmare. I was so excited to have the ice maker on the door to make more space in the freezer. I hate it. It is very noisy. It i...
, We are happy with our choice of this product and look forward to many years of using this product.
, The icemaker has a sound all it's own and our puppy runs to it everytime we get ice. She sure loves the icemaker. We do too!
, Very good refrigerator - keeps food at the temperature you want it. The ice maker is a little loud when it empties but is very efficient - I've never run out of ice. The fridge operation tends to be somewhat noisy however the variety of noises can be e...
, First, the ice maker is almost worthless. Most of the time it will not keep up enough ice for two people, and yes the repair has been done. Second, the water in the door is not cooled at all, so when you do have ice, the water melts what ice you have i...
, Poor quality. Doors uneven (not fixable) Don't close properly (again not fixable) Water filter leak Poor ice capacity and quality Good job moving to Mexico GOOD JOB keep up the good work never again
, ice maker is poorly designed... the bin is way too small....and the lever gets stuck on ice that is already made.....thereby preventing more ice from accumulating.
, Nice stylish design, love the lighting, and functions available for crushed ice, cubed ice. Keeps items cold evenly.
, This has been a great unit so far. The ice maker is great with the removeable ice bucket. The faux stainless look is easy to keep clean & looks nice. Also, the water filter is very easy to change. Overall for a refrigerator, it's very nice.
, We love the in door ice maker. This refrigerator has lots of room.
, Our old refrigerator broke down suddenly. We needed a quality, well priced replacement. This Whirlpool side by side model is exactly what we needed. Plenty of space with a sleek design and all the basic modern refrigerator conveniences. The in door ice...
, We have always had difficulty with the room and storage of items in the refrigerator. No longer with this item. The ice maker is especially designed great with space saving features. A must have for larger families.
, The biggest problem with this refrigerator is the ice maker. It makes smaller cubes, and, they do not last as long as cubes in the old Whirlpool fridge we used to own. It really doesn't make them very fast either, can't even keep up with two of us in s...
, water filter had to change very often about 2 month, so expensive
, This refrigerator has an excellent location for the ice maker. In the door works out so much better than actually in the freezer. It gives you more room in the freezer to keep it more organized.
, Basically I am happy with the appliance. The unit is more noisy than I would prefer. I could easily use another shelf in the frig portion.
, Overall satisfied with features and performance. The size is right for our kitchen. Outside finish is nice. The only downside I noticed was the size of ice cube dispensary (small).
, I like everything about this refrigerator. I especially like the ice machine.
, Looks great! Extremely noisy- we've had this refrigerator for several months now. It still wakes us up at night. The cats also flinch when ice drops or compressor starts. The In-Door Ice Plus Dispenser sounds like a good feature until you realize that ...
, The large spaces within the versitle shelves allows extra storage for preparing ahead of time for company. I removed a drawer to make space large enough to thaw a large turkey without having to rearrange other things. Since we often leave home for seve...
, Having owned 5 or 6 refrigerators, my main concern is they keep food cold. This one does, and it has good lighting inside so you can find the food. The meat drawer keeps meets extra cold, but doesn't freeze them(like a previous frig I owned.) It has a ...
, I was looking at a Frigidaire and a Whirlpool With comparable equipment had several issues with the features and the comparison and decided that the Whirlpool Would better suit my needs. In addition it fit my kitchen perfectly adding value and function...
, I love the look and space. Easily scratched though. Otherwise, great product.
, Would recommend this refrigerator Great features afforadable
, A primary reason for choosing this model was the fact that it fit into my existing opening in the kitchen. It seems as though refrigerators are much larger as far as dimensions. The side by side refrigerator has nice features; glass spill proof shelvin...
, I like the unit well enough but when I got it the delivery guys scratched it right away. No a Whirlpool problem but part of my frustration. Every time I touch the machine it gets a blemish, the stainless is not finger print friendly. Finally, when I us...
, I love this fridge though I wish there was better freezer organization, at least an extra shelf. Love the separate ice and water levers and that the dispenser lights up when in use. The fast ice feature gets quite a bit of use, and has been well worth it!
, I had to replace my last fridge and it came in a timely manner and works better than any product I have purchased
, Everything about the new refrigerator exceeds expectations; especially like the icemaker in the door.....saves valuable freezer space. The air and water filtration system are definitely a plus!
, So far, the product has been operating well, but we did have a bulb in the refrigerator burn out a few weeks after we got it. W did receive a replacement bulb from Whilrlpool, but it was the wrong one. The sent a freezer bulb which is different. We tol...
, We got this fridge to replace a 25 year-old machine. I like the side-by-side design and it has the right dimensions (something we had a hard time finding). Ice dispenser in the door is a great feature, but it sometimes spits out ice minutes afterward w...
, The fridge has lots of room inside, it is very deep (deeper than my counters - it sticks out a bit). I had to move the shelves around, but now I like the way it is set up. The freezer could be improved by having a few drawers instead of all shelves. I ...
, This is a great fridge but the ice maker does not make enough ice for a family of five.
, I have enjoyed Whirlpool appliances for a long time. They are consistently performing good reliable tasks with extra quality features at a reasonable price. I like the quality and reliability without adding so many complicated features that many new ap...
, Overall this refrigerator is excellent. From the design to operation, It satisfies a lot. When looking Inside, the refrigerator has big space to put everything in it. I like the ice maker part, it makes ice fast and ready to use. I will recommend this ...
, It has a lot of space inside it. Love the ice maker on the door.
, It's smaller than I thought inside. But it's easy to clean and looks great in our kitchen.
, easy to use,energy savings,style,design,performance
, I love this product and really like the room in the freezer due to the ice maker in the door! It is very energy efficient and plenty of room! The ice maker can be a little loud at night but not a major issue. I would definitely recommend this product.
, So far, so good. I have always had Amana Refrigerators, but the price was right and the features were excellent. it makes my kitchen look custom made and I love the space inside.
, I really like this refrigerator, except for a few things. I thought there would be more room in it, but because of the ice maker it takes a good portion of one side of the refrigerator. I also think that the left side of the refrigerator needs deeper s...
, overall very satisfied. the water intake broke and leaked on our floor. Was covered under warrenty and was fixed without issue. Whirlpool even paid for the damages to our floor! Was told by the the repair man that this was a known issue with several of...
, This refrigerator performs very well. It stylish and looks a lot like more expensive models. My only concern is the limited number of shelf placements. Seems like the perfect height for the shelves does not exist; they are either too high or too low. B...
, This product stopped cooling/freezing after two of being installed. All of my food spoiled while I was out of town. It almost three weeks to get a service technician out to look at it then an additional week for replacement parts to arrive. Needless to...
, This product gives lots of fridge space and looks great in any kitchen!
, I absolutely love the refrigerator with the ice maker in the door because it gives me so much more room in the side by side freezer. Unbelieveable how much extra room this has over the one I replaced. Thank you.
, The noise level of the ice falling into the door is quite loud and at first, a little concerning until you realize it is the ice maker. Also, I would prefer wheels on the whole bottom of the fridge for easier movement. From what I understand, the wheel...
, This product has alarm system when the door is open too long. However, the sound is loud when making ice.
, Quite noisy. Water dispenser a little slow. Ice maker very disappointing. Can't supply a family of two!
, We have been very happy with our new refrigerator. It works great, looks good, was affordable, and has a lot of room inside.
, The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't have the close up butter area in the fridge and I find the freezer to get kind of messy. I wish it had a second drawer at the bottom instead of a shelf. Also it could use another sh...
, Could not believe how much space there is in the fridge. Nice and easy to keep clean. Proud owner of this appliance.
, I've had repair twice. I'm calling again today. They replaced the freezer door which took six weeks to get. The freezer door still has a air leak.dripping water. down door onto my new laminate floor .
, The refrigerator is fine, nothing special. It does the job. I like the idea that the ice maker mechanism is in the door allowing for an extra shelf in the freezer.
, We ordered this refrigerator for our new home. It has a great deal of space and is able to accommodate our needs. There is plenty of space on both the refrigerator and freezer side. The extra door space is an added bonus.
, Great overall refrigerator! I love it, I do not understand why some people complain about the ice maker. Unless you own a restaurant and have to serve ice every 3 minutes this fridge will take care of any ice needs for a regular 4-6 people household.
, I have had this refridgerator for several months now, no complaints. Everything works fine, love the indoor ice maker. Plenty of space in unit.
, The only negative comment I have is the lack of ice storage. If you have a couple over for drinks, it is hard for the ice maker to keep up.
, This refrigerator's stainless exterior is resistant to finger prints! The features are those of higher priced models. Overall, it is a sharp looking addition to my kitchen!
, We are very happy thus far with our Whirlpool fridge vs other name brand we had. Cant believe how quiet the fridge is. We are use to having whirlpool products from the past. In a nutshell whirlpool is the best as far as we are concerned.
, Pros: I am extremely happy with this product design. Initially, I didn't want a side-by-side, but this refrigerator is pretty. The capacity is large, so I have not ran into any space issues (even through Thanksgiving leftovers!) The refrigerator has tw...
, We looked around at other refrigerator combinations before deciding on the Whirlpool. The others were a lot more expensive for the same features but were lacking when it came to ease of use and convenience. This is truly a great buy and exceeds all our...
, We are happy with the purchase of our new refrigerator, very easy to use and and it has a low sound level which is important since our kitchen and living room are open to each other.
, NO PROBLEMS THUS FAR. I WISH I COULD CHANGE THE SHAPE OF THE ICE CUBES. I AM PRETTY MUCH SATIFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT. THE WASHER AND DRYER I HAD YEARS AGO WERE VERY RELIABLE. I AM SURE THIS REFRIDGERATOR WILL PROVIDE YEARS OF TROUBLE FREE SERVICE.
, we wanted to replace our old Whirlpool bottom freezer with a more updated model and this hit all the points we were looking for -- a great bonus is the inside filtered water feature-- the style is perfect for our new kitchen
, This fridge has a larger depth than most other fridges. This allows for more food storage and more pots i can just put straight from stove into fridge. The icemaker works well. It was a plug-in and ready to go fridge. Note, before i installed the water...
, After purchasing this product in April 2013 worked fine until 5 months old and crack in hose leading to filter lead to my removal of lower drawers and noticed cracks are in lower left floor of appliance. Now unable to use water and ice feature and very...
, Our old fridge finally gave out and we wanted to replace it with a stainless steel model. After looking over several brands, we chose the Whirlpool 26 cu side by side. One of the reasons we went with Whirlpool was about 19 years ago we bought one for o...
, Everythng is enjoyable and functional except the ice maker. The ice cubes melt and stick together within 3 days... also the glue from all the cheap tape that is used to wrap the shelves in remains everywhere and is hard to clean
, I You are not going to believe in last 5 years I have had 4 brand new refridgetors all went bad. This is my last hope I had one Samsung, two Fridgedaires of couse the Kitchien Aid was the wrong color but the other three had a mechanical problem. So I w...
, I really like this new refrigerator, very pleased and happy with it.

, We love this refrigerator. After comparing different models, Whirpool seemed to have the most consistently high ratings. This replaced a 7 yr old GE that had numerous issues with it's icemaker and water dispenser. So far we have no complaints. Ice...
, This is by far the nicest appliance we've ever owned. We really like the in-door ice maker and filtered water.
, I love the room that it has in it for storage. The larger drawers make more room for stuff I like to stock up on. Over all I just think I made a great investment
, The ice maker is my biggest problem with this refrigerator, it's a poor design, and you WILL be taking it out once a month to clean out the out shoot which clogs with ice if you use the crushed ice feature. Also very very loud.
, We have been overall happy with our purchase - this refrigerator has a nice design and overall works well. LOTS of space for food storage. Like the ice dispenser in the door which gives more room for freezer storage. However, the water dispenser dispen...
, This is a nice appliance. I wanted a basic side by side and this appliance fits the need nicely. Good features, not more than I need. I like the water filter and ice in door features.
, This item has enough room inside to care for all of our needs. Also the inside door ice maker allow for extra space in the freezer compartment. The extra comparts allow for all of our fruits and veggies to stay fresh for a long time. This is a great re...
, We love the satin finish, no fingerprints. The icemaker is on the door and not on the inside of the freezer. More room in the freezer. When you open the doors, the lighting is great and plenty of room on the inside. Love everything about it and would r...
, I am very happy with the appearance and inside storage space. My only complaint is I wish the water was colder when dispensed from the water dispenser.
, I was a little worried about the high tech features on this refrigerator, but the instructions were very clear and easy to follow. I love the look and interior design. The freezer holds a huge amount, which was important to me. I love the icemakier in ...
, Only two problems. First, can't get shaved ice without it spilling onto the floor. I tried holding the glass as high up and close as I could but still had problem. Cubed ice isn't as bad. I still put the glass as high to to top as possible to keep the ...
, Overall, we like the refrigerator. It is sleek, fits nice with our other appliances, and has great features. You can select the exact temperature based on external conditions, and the contents in the fridge. In addtition to choosing the type of ice dis...
, Although the product looks excellent and is roomy with many good features, but we find that the operational noise level is higher than we expected and the ice maker performs way below expectations. We disappointed with the two features we have pointed ...
, Great purchase for the price. Overall we are happy. We have only 2 issues with the refrigerator so far. First the doors and handles are not even they are slightly off. And second we have had one jam with the ice maker when hosting a party and using if ...
, We really like this refrigerator. It looks great and functions well for our family.
, Really enjoying the filtered water and ice, drinking a lot more water . Everything has a place and is convenent to access.
, We never enjoyed using a refridge. like the one we perchased lately from whirlpool
, The space inside is large. Shelves are design for easy use. Information screen is helpful in programing settings. The unit is quiet.
, Overall the design is great. The sound level just needs to be perfected
, easy to keep clean, easy to view contents blah blah blah
, Well engineered. I went with this frig over a Samsung and am very please with it.
, Love the interior, nice lighting, seems very roomy, nice exterior finish. Like the ice in the door feature, but is a bit noisy. Would I buy it again....yes definitely...
, This refrigerator is so easy to clean and easy access to filter. Really like the ice cubes in the door and easy access to remove ice bucket.
, Very happy with my purchase!! Totally fits my needs!
, love everything about it exept it seems a little louder than our old whirlpool, and you have to push the doors shut all the way by hand. overall very pleased with all the features for the price.
, I love how much room there is in this refrigerator many shelfs and draws and compartments in both doors you can see everything when you open the doors. The freezer is very roomy also I was amazed at how much I could put in it very easy to operate the w...
, Unit is larger than our last refigerator/freezer unit, but actually has less storage space. No egg tray. You have to unload a shelf to get to the items in the back. Do like the ice dispenser/water tap.
, with the exception of the noise, I think this is one of the best side by side design
, The product was delivered and istalled as defective. It took more than a week for ABT service to come out and look at the issue only to tell me that there is a defective control panel, the same component that blew in my previous model.
, This is our third Whirlpool refrigerator and are overall satisfied. First week though the defrost function was not working. Called service and they discovered the wiring to the defrost timer came loose. Top shell in refrigerator side is not adjustable ...
, Cold water from the door is not very cold, makes more noise than the 12 year old refrigerator that it replaced,
, Bought it in May 2011. Really started using it in August 2011. My husband and I were remodeling our kitchen and a new refrigerator was not in the budget, but I kept complaining about our old/new french door-freezer drawer model we had purchased (Brand ...
, What can I say except that it's the best refrig. I have ever had! Love that the ice storage is on the inside of the door. Makes more room in the freezer. Don't find any faults with the refrig. at all. Very spacious. It's the second Whirlpool refrig. I ...
, I particularly like the in door ice maker that frees up space allowing more room in the freezer compartment. It runs quietly and the design allows for maximum use of both freezer and refrigerator space.
, Poor design when comes to noise. Door squeaks every time opening & close. Fan noise is loud. Positive design in space for storage.
, I would recommend the fridge without reservation. It has a large interior designed for maximum useable storage. The flexible shelf choices allow us to set up the refrigerator for the foods and drinks we use daily. The large openings for the in-door wat...
, We looked at a lot of refrigerators that cost a whole lot more that couldn't lure us away and a few that were similar in price that just didn't measure up. We loved it since the day it was delivered!
, I love my refrigerator. Ot is tge best I have ever had
, It is the average sound of a refrigerator...i was expecting it to be a little more quiet. I have a lot of space to move things around in there. And i would definitely recommend it to my friends. i did a lot of research before I bought it and I must say...
, There is plenty of room in both the freezer and refrigerator part. It is very easy to keep clean and it has some good features. I like the warning light and sound it makes if you leave the refrigerator door open. It also has a fast ice feature which is...
, I've used better. The outside collects spots and is terrible to wipe down. The icemaker is particularily loud. However, if you're looking for a basic refrigerator that looks nice (once you've eliminated those spots) this one will do just fine.
, We're happy with the look of this refrigerator as well as with the configuration of the shelves. We have more than sufficient room for storing items both in the refrigerator & freezer sides. The only minor complaint we would mention is that the ice mak...
, The features on this refrigerator/freezer is top notch. Our whole family loves it and would not have anything else. Love the look and the ease of cleaning. Wow
, excellant product,grear features decent price,energey saver
, Wonderful product but difficult to move and clean condersor coils.
, This product has space and performance at a reasonable price in today's market. The ice maker on the freezer door instead of in the freezer is a great space saver. The deep shelves have added grocery space that we needed. We were reluctant at first to ...
, I am very pleased with my selection of this refrigerator. The ice maker works well and has a perfect balance when it comes to dispensing ice (some makers throw ice at you, others you have to shake the whole fridge!). The only suggestion I would have fo...
, The no stain stainless finish is wonderful. Lots of room and the vegtable store is very efficient.
, The in the door ice maker is what we really like. It gives more freezer space.
, I am disappointed that the ice maker does not make ice very fast. Takes 3 days to fill up the container. Only one person in the household :( Wish it had more shelves in each compartment. At least one.
, I like how the shelves and drawers are set up. The ice part however doesn't make enough ice. I have a family of 5 and it struggles to keep up with us. It does have the fast ice feature which I like. I would recommend this product. Its a good deal for t...
, We wanted the side by side refrigerator and we really liked the lay out of the interior as well as the lighting of the interior too. We liked the look of this product.
, Previously owned GE Profile. Water dispenser was hit or miss. Ice dispenser required use of arm muscles to press hard enough on the lever to dispense ice. On the Whirlpool, you barely have to press and get water and ice every time. Also, even though th...
, So far, I am very pleased with my new Whirlpool refrigerator. It has all the features I wanted, and the smooth black finish matches all of my other whirlpool appliances. The capacity is wonderful, and the water dispenser provides better tasting water t...
, This is a good solid Fridge. Nothing special in terms of features but keeps things cold, is quite, attractive and makes good use of space
, When we began looking for a fridge we had a couple of things we wanted. One it had to be able to hold 4 gallon jugs of milk. Secondly we wanted a fridge where the ice maker didn't take up most of the space in the freezer, This fridge gave us both and i...
, We love our new Whirlpool side by side refrigerator. We love all the features it has. The family loves the ice maker cause it works excellent. I would recommend this product to everyone.
, Refrigerator has plenty of selves and space. 6th sense is a cool feature. It's a bit loud when compressor is running and the ice maker spout could use some help with the design. Lets not make a square exit when most cup are round. Ice goes everywhere.
, Ice maker in the freezer door is nice. Ice maker can be a little noisy. Built in egg container in the refrigerator would be nice.
, I also want to praise the Whirlpool team. About a month after buying the refrigerator a door shelf fell and broke off. They replaced without any hassle or questions. I was impressed
, We like this model overall, but don't know if we'd get the same type of ice maker again. The ice bin is in the door of the freezer and we occasionally have issues with frost building up in the dispensing area. Otherwise, the refrigerator and freezer wo...
, The icemaker quit working after only 2 months. This will probably be the first and last Whirlpool product we will buy. Not real impressed with the quality so far.
, Everything seems fine, but it is really loud. It looks great and has plenty of room.
, This product was chosen to replace an older side by side made by another brand. The value provided by this Whirlpool brand is far better than the unit it replaced.
, One feature I would like is an egg shelf.Ihad one before and am used to it. I do like the ice maker in the door. It was one reason I bought this model.I wish the light would stay on longer, that way I could also fill my glass. small problem with ice cu...
, We really find the space in this refrigerator great! All of the bins are easy to use and very handy. We also find the ice maker very good - like it in the door to give more room in the freezer area. Everything works great!
, This product seems to run fine and cools/freezes items adequately and has all the features advertised. However, aesthetically it could use some fine tuning of the details. 1. On the exterior,it has a nice finish for the color, but the door handles and ...
, I've had side-by-side refrigerators before and I like them. Mine looks pretty and it works well too. I live where it's hot a lot of the year so I go through a lot of ice. I love that it's easy to either get it through the door dispenser or open the doo...
, We got a great deal (price wise) on our fridge. We wanted the look of stainless steel and got one with the finish that does not show finger prints...a life saver when it comes to wiping the surface. The extra feature that is our favorite...the icemaker...
, Been pleased with the purchase. I wasn't looking for a whole lot of flare. I just wanted something that would do its job well and so far I have been happy with my decision.
, We got a whirlpoo because they have first class Products
, Really like my new refrigerator. It is very well lite inside. I can see food even in the back. The solid shelves are a big plus, especially if there is a spill. I do wish there were more shelf height options. Be careful using the ice dispenser. If the ...
, Best fridge we've ever owned. Wife loves the space, both in the freezer and fridge box. The adjustable shelves are awesome. The ice maker in the door gives much more space in the freezer. Very good looking fridge.
, This fridge is excellent - not too pricey, but has all the features needed. It's a great size (shelves and sides are adjustable) and doesn't make too much noise. It also beeps at you if you leave the door open... pretty useful :) all in all, I recommen...
, This is the best fridge I ever owned. Hand down very nice. Love the purified water
, it has a lot of room. the ice maker is attached to the door so it givea you extra room in the freezer. easy to clean with microfiber cloth
, I just wish the water would be colder from the filter but otherwise I am very happy with my purchase.
, This has lots of space as the ice maker is in the door. More shelves which I like.
, The unit is very spacious. The adjustable shelves make storing all sizes of containers very convenient. The in door ice maker is a great feature allowing for more storage room in the freezer. The finish allows for quick and easy cleaning. A great buy f...
, I am so thrilled with our recent refrigerator purchase. There is nothing better then looking inside and seeing everything without having to bend over or peer through things. I just look into the refrigerator and can spot my item in seconds. Great compa...
, i really like all my whirlpool applicances including the refrigerator
, Love the size of both sides, water and ice in the door, glass shelves easy to clean and the electronics warning when door is open, icons on freezer door are great and the stainless is so easy to keep clean. Ice holder removes so easily for dumping.
, We don't like slide out freezer so this side by side was exactly what we were looking for. Matches our other kitchen products. It is quiet. Should have had more shelves. Had to buy two additional shelves to complete the unite. Ice maker works well. Wat...
, We bought a spec home that included whirlpool appliances. We chose this fridge because it fit in with the stainless appliances that we included in the home purchase. We had the fridge in the home for exactly 1 month before the ice maker went bad and ne...
, This is a good refrigerator. However the door hinges need to be placed correctly so that when the doors closed, the edge are well aligned with the body of the refrigerator. Because the anchor bolts for the hinges are incorrectly placed, the edge of the...
, When the icemaker drops the ice cubes I can hear it all over the house. That is why I only gave the sound levels and average. I feel that because the icemaker was moved to the door this is why the loud sound. Otherwise I like all the features. Loads of...
, we likr this fridge and it works real good. I wish it was SS all over.
, This unit is replacing an old 1980's upper-lower refrigerator that came with our house. It has been amazing. The in-door water and ice dispenser leave the freezer VERY roomy! No complaints. love this fridge!
, The first thing my wife did when we got this new refrigerator was to adjust the shelves so she could have another shelf for things. The bottom two shelves are meant to be together but my wife wanted it moved up. By doing that, the tray won't close all ...
, This is the first side by side I have had and I love it. I had heard conflicting stories about them before I purchased it, but I love it. Easy to find thing and plenty of room
, Purchase as part of a new home. Wanted up scale appliances on a budget. This product would compare to much higher priced designs from other manufactures. Controls are easy to use and look very nice. Finish is perfect and seems easy to keep clean then o...
, This frig. replaced a 12 year old 27.5 cu.ft. Even though it's smaller, it's got more usable space. Much more movable shelving and bins. The ice maker in the door is fantastic! Thought the storage bin would be to small, but I haven't even come close to...
, The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of where the on/off switch is for the icemaker. You shouldn't have to take out the ice bucket to get to the switch, it should be out in plain sight and easy to get to. I can't comment on the icemaker or the water...
, This fridge was exactly what we were looking for. We wanted a fridge that had the ice maker in the door. This product has more room then most side by side because the ice maker is actually on the door. Most side by sides, the ice maker takes up space i...
, Love this fridge- have not had a problem with anything
, I like this item very much it is a little noise when the water cycles the little plastic cover in the freezer does not stay in place but not a big deal other than that it is great
, I honestly could not be more happy with my purchase of our new Stainless Steel Whirlpool Side By Side Refrigerator. I was so disapointed when our very old model broke down because I was nervous about the cost and process of buying a replacement. It did...
, Very bright inside! Easy to use and clean! The ice maker is a little noisy but it works well!
, We bought this refrigerator to replace a 3 year old Samsung that was defective. We have had Whirlpool appliances in the past and the reviews on this model were very positive. Over all this is an excellent value. It cools quickly and the temperature sta...
, nice refrigerator. the water comes out too slow. it needs another shelf in the refrigerator side. the color is nice. it's easy to program.
, Performs well. Great value for the price. A little noisy but not terribly.
, I lost my old refrigerator in susperstorm sandy, and I purchsed this one and I am so happy with it, the outside looks modern, the ice maker and water on the door work great and theres tons of room for food and items, and at an afforadable price.
, I am pleased with it but I do believe the shelves could be stronger. The drawers do not slide easy either.
, We had lots of trouble finding a unit to fit our box. This one was the only one that maximized our space without being too small. It's sleek and modern looking, with practical features. All it's missing is the egg holder.
, Except for the lack of shelves on the door, I really like this refrigerator
, The ice maker being in the door is an awesome feature. It gives so much more room in the freezer section. The refrigerator side has a lot of space for cold items and seems so much larger than my previous refrigerator, which actually had a little more c...
, So far, we've had no issues with this refrigerator. It's quiet and works great. Love the stainless steel look without all the fingerprints. We don't use the icemaker so can't comment on that.
, I do like our new fridge. The exterior is very nice with the stainless and black. The inside, esp the drawers, do not slide as easy as I would like and seem that they may break easily. Overall, it works well and is spacious!
, Too noisy, ice capacity limited with small cubes. Love whirlpool but wouldn't buy this fridge again.
, So far, have found the refrigerator to be excellent and it looks very nice.
, Everything works great and plenty of room in fridge and freezer. Water does not come out cold, only thing wrong.
, My husband bought this fridge for me while I was deployed to Afghanistan. It is a great fridge. I love the ice maker in the freezer door, it really frees up space. The ice maker and water dispenser are very convenient. Where I live the water isn't so g...
, First the good. This is a fine looking appliance. The stainless steel buffs up real nice with a stainless steel cleaner. The lines are also well done. The long handles complementing the long dispenser actuators. Inside the compartments are well lit, as...
, This product has lots of room.... The ice machine is in the door so it frees up so much space.....
, looks and runs great, but needs an extra shelf in freezer and buying 1 is $$$
, I have had this refridgerator for over 4 months now. Have not had any problems whatsoever. Only negative would be a minor blemish on the the stainless under the ice dispensor. Good looking appliance
, This is a great fridge at a reasonable price. We previously had a bottom drawer freezer unit, and were concerned about storage in a side by side. But the shelving is very versatile in this unit, and we easily fit the same amount of frozen food in this ...
, Really love our new fridge. There is plenty of space in both areas and the ice and water dispenser are very handy. I've noticed our vegetables stay fresh a lot longer than they did in our old refrigerator.
, This is a great frig. We bought a 4 piece whirlpool appliance package and are very pleased with all of our appliances. The frig is great the ice maker in the door took some getting use to it does save space and makes some funky sounds when it despenses...
, Very surprised on how well this unit works. Very quiet and keeps frozen food perfect. Best thing keeps ice cream at the right temp so when you need it serves smooth. Not hard as a rock.
, The deciding factor for picking this refrigerator was the ice maker being on the freezer door. It's easy to pull out the ice bucket and there is a lot more room in the freezer.

, works great, drop in washer & let the cycle run...
, works like a charm. no more yukky smell. love the product.
, Does a decent job. Definitely smells better afterwards!
, In my opinion it wastes water - but it is easy to use
, Light on machine stays on until you add and follow instructions. Running a cup of vinegar did not work. MACHINEINSTRUCTIONS SAYSTO USE AFTER 30 LOADS.
, It is pretty good to keep your dishwasher clean. I use this one every month. Normally I use my dishwasher one time each day.
, Works well when my fancy new washing machine begins to smell. With all that technology, why should I have to wash the washer?
, It is nice to purchase a product that does what it is suppose to do. This product helps keep your clothes smelling clean and fresh by removing residue that even bleach still leaves behind in your washer.
, Smells great and cleans the washer very nicely
, Great for keeping the washer from retaining odors from usages. No odors is the way to go.
, DOES IT'S JOB
, We used the product to get rid if a mildew/moldy smell coming from our new front load washing machines. The instructions were easy, and correct. After just one use there was no more odor. Yeah!
, Used one tablet in my washer, then spent the next half hour cleaning out the chalky film it left behind. I even tried to run the tub clean cycle again without cleaner to rinse it out to no avail.
, Always leave the door open when not using your front loading washer. This product insures that no nasty molds will be a toe hold!
, Per manufacturer's recommendations on our HE washer, we are to use this product monthly to sanitize the washer drum. This product is extremely simple to use, and it seems to meet expectations, but I really have no way of knowing for sure that it is...
, works really good, keeps my washer clean, refreshed and smelling good.
, I have been using this product over 2 years now and have had no problems.
, Easy to use and works well. I use 1 a month and when the washer is not in use I leave the door open for it to dry out thereby reducing the chance of mold.

, did an excellent job of getting rid of the odor from our washer... will be using it every month
, Have only used this product once and it seems to do what it's advertised to do. Hopefully I will feel the same after a year.
, You may need a few treatments but they made a big impact on our front loader.

, I like to keep our front loading machine smelling good with Affresh. Be sure to wipe out any remaining residue as the directions state.
, I have used Affresh tabs faithfully every month since I bought my new Whirlpool Duet washer last March. One thing I have learned over the years is keeping any machine working well and for the long-term is scheduled maintenance and consistent cleaning....
, works for a short time, then ordor is back. tried again after a few weeks and still not a great job at getting rid of the ordor.
, After searching all over to find this product, I discovered I could find it on line at Home Depot and have it shipped to my door free...great.
, the product came highly recommended, and I had to mail order it, but unfortunately did nothing for the black mold inside the rubber gasket of my washer...
, Our front load wash machine started to get a smell that we eventually figured was mold starting to grow. I hand cleaned the gasket and then used Affresh. I was very pleased with the outcome. I gave it 4 stars because I only used it one time so far and...
, I bought a used front load washer and it had already had the scent of mold when I picked them up. Then over the last year, it has progressively gotten worse. I leave the door open after each wash to help prevent that from happening. Then finally it was...
, I bought affresh because my washer had an oder to it. I followed the directions and used all three tablets and it did nothing for the oder. I found a clorox washing machine cleaner that only took one wash to clear it up at half the price.
, I never knew of a monthly cleaner for front loading machines. I had been cleaning it and leaving door open to remove smell. After over 3 years of owning washer, I am now able to clean monthly. Great little product.
, I purchased Whirlpool Duet Front Loaders. The sales person told us to purchase the Affresh tablets to clean the washer about every 2-3 months, to prevent mold or and bacteria from growing. We did just that. We always keep the dispenser door and front...
, A home renovation 5 years ago allowed me to build a larger laundry room. I purchased 2 front loading Whilrpool washing machines. While I LOVE the machines, I noticed after awhile that they had a very funky smell after doing a wash. I tried cleaning...
, After thinking my new front-loading washer was defective for many months and having no help from Maytag/Whirlpool, I finally found this product (ironically made by them!).  I'd taken numerous other steps to resolve the mildew problem, but this was the ...
, You don't dare leave a load of laundry in our washer after the cycle has ended or you might have to throw the close out because of the smell. After running one of these tablets through the smell is mostly gone (our machine seems to be an extreme exampl...
, Great product at a reasonable price!
, Not sure if something is amiss, but these tablets seem to offer no difference. We still get residue and odor as before, even using these tablets on a monthly basis. We initially cleaned the entire machine, and then started using these tablets as mainte...
, Our Kenmore HE washer had black stains and mildew in the tub and our clothes stunk. I used three tablets for the initial cleaning, as directed, and now the stains and odors are gone. Now we drop one in each month between washings.  For the price, we pu...
, Easy to use and makes the washer look and smell wonderful!  Very pleased with the results!
, This product  worked wonderful.  It took the smell out of my front load washing machine.  It also helps to keep the door open after washes to air out the inside.  I will buy this product again.
, Explaining how the product works better than bleach alone to clean out the crud from the clothes washer
, I used three tablets as instructed but didn't notice too much of a difference.  My washer still had a bad smell as if the Affresh didn't get rid of the mold.
, took care of problem, but also found bleach run threw the clean cycle does same thing
, This item works great as it says to use, I cannot say it will make your washer smell like roses if you let it go until yours smells like a septic tank.  Use them one time a month as it says and it will do exactly what it says and PREVENT mildew and the...
, My front loader began smelling mildewy, and I finally found a product to make it go away.  It's very easy to use.  Just throw a tablet in the normal cycle with hot water and run the cycle.  It cleans the drum of the washer.
, I would say try it. It can't hurt to try. To be honest, I'm not sure if it worked or not? How can you tell? It seemed like next load was a little cleaner. Not a big difference. Maybe wishful thinking, right?
, Every 30 days I use one tablet and set the machine to the sanitary cycle.  Front load washers have a nasty problem with mold and smell problems. It is important to leave the door open after every wash cycle.  Use the tablet as a preventive measure. Onc...
, I had musty smelling towels and clothes. Tried bleach, vinegar and extended wash cycle in front loader to get rid of the odor. These Affresh tablets smell great and seem to eliminate the odor in the washer drum. I have not used them long enough to see ...
, Pros: Cleans my Maytag HE washer.  No longer has the mildewy smell.  Cons: None really.  Other Thoughts:  I wish I would have known about this product sooner, would have saved me many loads.
, This is a great buy
, Very easy to use, and gets the job done!
, This product works as described in the directions which are quite simple.  I find it does last longer between cleanings of the wash barrel, especially if you like to use hot water when washing clothes as this causes the correct temperature for that pin...
, [...] Product as described.  Great price.  What else can you say!  Abt is awesome.  I get my fridge water filters through them too.
, Used once a month, this stuff does an awesome job of keeping my washing machine mold- and stink-free!
, My Duet Front Load Washer had a mildew smell and I used the Affresh as directed and the smell is gone.
, Our washer had a slightly moldy smell before we used Affresh.  I ran one tablet through each of three cycles (I did two normal and one sanitize) and the smell is gone!  Our clothes smell better and we can use our towels more than once now without them ...
, This product is great for getting that fresh washer smell back. Stock up on these!
, These are MUST-HAVE tablets to keep your washer 'fresh'! Once a month drop one in and run the cycle to clean it and voila! Couldn't be any easier.  Keep your washer door open in-between washes to help dry it out too.
, The facts are this.  Use affresh once a month or else.  I have owned two front loader washing machines in 7 years.  The first one was never treated with this product and in a matter of 2 years it developed a horrible smell.  The Kenmore washer was full...
, If you own a top or front HE washer, this is a must. It keeps your washer fresh. Before I purchased my Maytag HE washer I had a regular Maytag. Boy, I tried everything to clean that washer. Nothing worked. A light comes on the new washer to let me know...

, I bought this microwave to replace a 3 year old GE that just quit working. I was very skeptical about getting another GE but I didn't want to spend a lot of money and I didn't wanted to drill new holes and install a new bracket. I just wanted a quick, ...
, This microwave was to replace a similar one (also GE) that was a lemon. I probably would've gotten another brand/model but was worried about how easily it would fit into the current setup over my range. It is easy to use but I find it quite noisy, espe...
, I bought this microwave after my GE Profile convection microwave oven needed a new magnetron, and the parts plus labor was more than buying a new one. Needless to say, I was very unhappy since that oven was only 3 years old. The oven is very easy to us...
, This is a good looking microwave that fits my decor well. It was a relatively good price when comparing feature to feature with other brands. I am pleased with the fit, finish and operation of the microwave.
, We had our house built in 2008 in a 300+ development. Everyone in this community has the same microwave and so far at least a dozen of these microwaves have stopped working. The builder won't do anything and GE certainly won't do anything to fix the pr...
, Chose this mirowave to match my GE range and for the features it had. Very well thought out controls. I'm learning more about it every time I use it.
, We have been happy with this microwave. The keypad is a bit large, but otherwise it has a nice appearance and the price is right.
, Very well built, quiet, and easy to install, but I have not owned this unit very long. Time will tell weather it is quality long term
, Am looking to get GE to replace with another comparable model after having got this one exchanged for the third time with different units, first one came with a faulty wave guide, second had scratches all over the handle on delivery, and the third has...
, Do not purchase this microwave! After about two years half of the keys on the key pad stopped working so I did some research and apparently this is a major problem with the microwave which GE just refuses to address. I called them to see what it would...
, I read numerous reviews, some of which were VERY negative. However I purchased this unit to replace my other GE microwave which stopped working after nearly 8 years. I was tempted to try a Samsung, but the negative reviews changed my mind. I went with...
, The plastic covering over the number pad developed air bubbles under it after only one day of use. It's installed, so it's too much of a hassle to return it. So we'll just have to deal with its unsightly appearance.
, Newish styling with none of the front facing air vents (they point up and are not visible), express cook buttons on GE microwaves are great, it works and is comparatively inexpensive. It does not have convection oven features or anything fancy but...
, Fits our needs just great. Excellent service and delivery. Definitely would order from Abt again when the need arises. They go out of their way to provide above and beyond customer service.
, What a waste of money. Very disappointing. Now I need a new one [...]. My original panasonic still works after 25 years
, We love our microwave. It is very roomy and so far no problems.
, This was put in our new home (builder choice), and I am already paing the repair man!!! After 2 years, there is a faulty wire. Total repair cost is $289. Unbelievable!
, This microwave started off with a rattling noise after the installation for several days. It could have been the installation by the workers. The vent system is not exactly how I would like for it to work, it is very noisy. The other uses of the...
, A good quality, nor frills microwave that does the job, and matches my range, and refrigerator. Great value, and it has worked well for us over the last 7 - 8 months.
, Our family has been satisfied with this product. It's a little slower than our last GE microwave in heating things up; 30 seconds on high does not heat at the same level, which causes us to add an additional 15-30 seconds. We really like the venting...
, My microwave turntable failed the first day it was installed. It would stop and start. A GE repairman arrived a week after I called and changed the turntable stepping motor. That fixed the problem. Also, the door is hard to open and close. The latch...
, Great efficient appliance with very versatile features. Only disappointment is the interior light flickers constantly while operational. Light requires frequent replacement. Otherwise, it is a very reliable appliance.
, THIS LOOKS GREAT ABOVE MY GE PROFILE COOKTOP. IT NOT ONLY LOOKS GREAT BUT I'VE NEVER HAD LESS POPCORN SEEDS UNPOPPED. THE REHEAT FEATURE IS THE BEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD! I USE THAT THE MOST OF ALL.
, Microwave powered down by itself and remained off for over an hour when supplied metal shelf used, even though directions on use were followed. Control panel feels soft -- required too much pressure to set.
, I like the look, performance and ease of installation. I had GE (balck).
, Cooks/heats wonderfully! Wish the light was brighter and the fan quieter. But it does what it should!
, overall this is a great microwave. the only complaint we have at this point is how loud the vent is.
, The quality is not that great and the air vent makes a loud noise when on (more than my old microwave).
, Love it! Looks great, peforms perfectly...excellent fan w/o the excessive noise and the underneath surface-light is brighter then most options I compared.
, This microwave looks great and heats quickly. It wasn't too hard to install. We haven't had any trouble with it. I would recommend it. I haven't really played around with the sensor, but that's cause I usually just heat things up for a minute or 2 and ...
, Died soon after I got it. Had GE service come out to repair it; it died again after a month.
